\section*{Acknowledgements} 
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

Firstly I would like to thank my supervisor, Karim Sorefan, for guiding me through the project, but also allowing me to take it in the directions I wanted to go, i.e. away from the bench, out of the lab door, and towards the computer! Thanks also to Ian Sudbery for his guidance in the world of bioinformatics, and for allowing me to join his lab's meetings and journal club, without which I would have been stuck with only the wet lab biologists for company. Also thanks to Marta Milo who has helped me with a number of statistics problems over the last four years, and Stuart Casson, for asking good questions in lab meetings. I'd also like to thank Jeremy Craven, whose Python course, which I took at undergraduate level, was what first got me hooked on programming and bioinformatics.

From the Sorefan and Casson labs there are many people to thank. Firstly, Colette Baxter, Manoj Valluru, Giulia Arsuffi, Nick Zoulias, who between them did all of the wet lab experiments which provided me with data to analyse. Colette's RNAseq data was of particularly high quality (so many FDRs < 0.05!). Secondly, to James Thackery, for being a ridiculously handsome devil and a hilarious human being; Matthew Proctor, for being neither (just kidding); and Rachel Denley Bowers, for taking me the the hospital at Peter Venn's wedding (Colette also helped out there).

Finally I'd like to thank Catherine Heath, for putting up with me chatting about bioinformatics when she clearly wasn't interested, and for generally making my life pretty wonderful.
