TODO:

 * Introduction
 * Materials and Methods:
  * plant conditions and drug treatment from colette
  * qpcr and sanger sequencing from colette
 * Results:
  * Fix ext showalter table to add correct PG4 estimations (coding already done just needs inkscaping)
  * Fix tables so they are numbered separately from figures
  * Change expression vs splice percent scatter so that expression is logCPM normalised
  * NMM splicing section
   * DEXseq analysis - P value histogram and MA plot.
   * Percent spliced over EXTs.
 * Discussion
 * References
 * Appendix:
  * LRX1 / EXT9 splicing gels from colette
  * Code or pseudocode for PG4 counting
