TODO:

 * Introduction
 * Materials and Methods:
  * plant conditions and drug treatment from colette
  * qpcr and sanger sequencing from colette
 * Results:
  * Fix ext showalter table to add correct PG4 estimations (coding already done just needs inkscaping)
  * Fix tables so they are numbered separately from figures
  * Change expression vs splice percent scatter so that expression is logCPM normalised
  * NMM splicing section - figures:
   * Diagram showing splice site classification.
   * Frequency of different splice site classes
   * Relative expression of different splice site classes
   * Frequency of different splice site classes in DE set.
   * G Quadruplex enrichments within or flanking DE spliced
   * Change in percent spliced over EXTs.
 * Discussion
 * References
 * Appendix:
  * LRX1 / EXT9 splicing gels from colette
  * Code or pseudocode for PG4 counting
