abstract = {The G-quadruplex is an alternative DNA structural motif that is considered to be functionally important in the mammalian genome for transcriptional regulation, DNA replication and genome stability, but the nature and distribution of G-quadruplexes across the genome remains elusive. Here, we address the hypothesis that G-quadruplex structures exist within double-stranded genomic DNA and can be explicitly identified using a G-quadruplex-specific probe. An engineered antibody is employed to enrich for DNA containing G-quadruplex structures, followed by deep sequencing to detect and map G-quadruplexes at high resolution in genomic DNA from human breast adenocarcinoma cells. Our high sensitivity structure-based pull-down strategy enables the isolation of genomic DNA fragments bearing single, as well as multiple G-quadruplex structures. Stable G-quadruplex structures are found in sub-telomeres, gene bodies and gene regulatory regions. For a sample of identified target genes, we show that G-quadruplex-stabilizing ligands can modulate transcription. These results confirm the existence of G-quadruplex structures and their persistence in human genomic DNA.},

abstract = {Circular dichroism (CD) is a phenomenon that arises from the differential absorption of left- and right-handed circularly polarized light, and may be seen with optically active molecules. CD spectroscopy provides useful spectral signatures for biological macromolecules in solution, and provides low-resolution structural information about macromolecular conformation. CD spectroscopy is particularly useful for monitoring conformational changes in macromolecules upon environmental perturbations. G-quadruplex structures show unique CD spectral signatures, and CD is an important tool for characterizing their formation and global structure. This protocol offers step-by-step methods for determining reliable and reproducible CD spectra of quadruplex structures and normalizing the spectra for presentation. CD spectra properly normalized with respect to quadruplex concentration and path length are required to facilitate accurate comparison of results among laboratories. The standard operating procedures proposed are recommended to make such comparison accurate and informative. {\textcopyright} 2017 by John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {The exosome is a key RNA machine that functions in the degradation of unwanted RNAs. Here, we found that significant fractions of precursors and mature forms of mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs are degraded by the nuclear exosome in normal human cells. Exosome‐mediated degradation of these RNAs requires its cofactor hMTR4. Significantly, hMTR4 plays a key role in specifically recruiting the exosome to its targets. Furthermore, we provide several lines of evidence indicating that hMTR4 executes this role by directly competing with the mRNA export adaptor ALYREF for associating with ARS2, a component of the cap‐binding complex (CBC), and this competition is critical for determining whether an RNA is degraded or exported to the cytoplasm. Together, our results indicate that the competition between hMTR4 and ALYREF determines exosome recruitment and functions in creating balanced nuclear RNA pools for degradation and export.The EMBO Journal (2017) 36: 2870–2886},

abstract = {The RNA Pol II transcription complex pauses just downstream of the promoter in a significant fraction of human genes. The local features of genomic structure that contribute to pausing have not been defined. Here, we show that genes that pause are more G-rich within the region flanking the transcription start site (TSS) than RefSeq genes or non-paused genes. We show that enrichment of binding motifs for common transcription factors, such as SP1, may account for G-richness upstream but not downstream of the TSS. We further show that pausing correlates with the presence of a GrIn1 element, an element bearing one or more G4 motifs at the 5'-end of the first intron, on the non-template DNA strand. These results suggest potential roles for dynamic G4 DNA and G4 RNA structures in cis-regulation of pausing, and thus genome-wide regulation of gene expression, in human cells.},

abstract = {The origin and importance of exon-intron architecture comprises one of the remaining mysteries of gene evolution. Several studies have investigated the variations of intron length, GC content, ordinal position in a gene and divergence. However, there is little study about the structural variation of exons and introns. We investigated the length, GC content, ordinal position and divergence in both exons and introns of 13 eukaryotic genomes, representing plant and animal. Our analyses revealed that three basic patterns of exon-intron variation were present in nearly all analyzed genomes (P {\textless} 0.001 in most cases): an ordinal reduction of length and divergence in both exon and intron, a co-variation between exon and its flanking introns in their length, GC content and divergence, and a decrease of average exon (or intron) length, GC content and divergence as the total exon numbers of a gene increased. In addition, we observed that the shorter introns had either low or high GC content, and the GC content of long introns was intermediate. Although the factors contributing to these patterns have not been identified, our results provide three important clues: common factor(s) exist and may shape both exons and introns; the ordinal reduction patterns may reflect a time-orderly evolution; and the larger first and last exons may be splicing-required. These clues provide a framework for elucidating mechanisms involved in the organization of eukaryotic genomes and particularly in building exon-intron structures.},

The regulation of BCL-2 gene expression is highly complex and occurs both transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally. In particular, the 5′ upstream region of BCL-2 contains a number of elements that control its expression. We have identified a highly conserved 25- nucleotide G-rich sequence (BCL2Q), with potential to fold into a RNA G-quadruplex structure, located 42 nucleotides upstream of the translation start site of human BCL-2. In this study, we used a series of biophysical experiments to show that the BCL2Q sequence folds into a stable RNA G-quadruplex in vitro, and we conducted functional luciferase reporter-based assays, in a cell-free lysate and in three types of human cell lines, to demonstrate that the BCL2Q sequence modulates protein expression in the context of the 493-nucleotide native 5′ untranslated region of BCL-2.},

abstract = {The formation of R-loops is a natural consequence of the transcription process, caused by invasion of the DNA duplex by nascent transcripts. These structures have been considered rare transcriptional by-products with potentially harmful effects on genome integrity owing to the fragility of the displaced DNA coding strand. However, R-loops may also possess beneficial effects, as their widespread formation has been detected over CpG island promoters in human genes. Furthermore, we have previously shown that R-loops are particularly enriched over G-rich terminator elements. These facilitate RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pausing before efficient termination. Here we reveal an unanticipated link between R-loops and RNA-interference-dependent H3K9me2 formation over pause-site termination regions in mammalian protein-coding genes. We show that R-loops induce antisense transcription over these pause elements, which in turn leads to the generation of double-stranded RNA and the recruitment of DICER, AGO1, AGO2 and the G9a histone lysine methyltransferase. Consequently, an H3K9me2 repressive mark is formed and heterochromatin protein 1gamma (HP1gamma) is recruited, which reinforces Pol II pausing before efficient transcriptional termination. We predict that R-loops promote a chromatin architecture that defines the termination region for a substantial subset of mammalian genes.},

abstract = {The proximal promoter region of many human growth-related genes contains a polypurine/polypyrimidine tract that serves as multiple binding sites for Sp1 or other transcription factors. These tracts often contain a guanine-rich sequence consisting of four runs of three or more contiguous guanines separated by one or more bases, corresponding to a general motif known for the formation of an intramolecular G-quadruplex. Recent results provide strong evidence that specific G-quadruplex structures form naturally within these polypurine/polypyrimidine tracts in many human promoter regions, raising the possibility that the transcriptional control of these genes can be modulated by G-quadruplex-interactive agents. In this chapter, we describe three general biochemical methodologies, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), dimethylsulfate (DMS) footprinting, and the DNA polymerase stop assay, which can be useful for initial characterization of G-quadruplex structures formed by G-rich sequences.},

abstract = {The G-quadruplex is one of the most frequently studied secondary DNA structures and consists of 4 guanine residues that interact through Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen pairing. The G-quadruplex formation is thought to be a molecular switch for gene expression. Genome-wide analyses of G-quadruplexes have been published for many species; however, only one genome-wide analysis of G-quadruplexes in plants has been reported. Here, we propose a new approach involving a two-step procedure for identifying G-quadruplex-forming sequences (potential G4 DNA motif regions: G4MRs) and classifying positional relationships between G4MRs and genes. By using this approach, we exhaustively searched for G4MRs in the whole genomes of 8 species: Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa subsp. japonica, Populus trichocarpa, Vitis vinifera, Homo sapiens, Danio rerio, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans. We classified genes on the basis of their positional relationships to their proximal G4MRs. We identified novel rules for G4MRs in plants, such as G4MR-enrichment in the template strands at transcription start sites (TSSs). Next, we focused on the template strands of TSSs and conducted gene ontology (GO) analysis of genes proximal to G4MRs. We identified GO terms such as chloroplast and nucleosome (or histone) in O. sativa. Although these terms were strongly associated in O. sativa, weak associations were identified in other plants. These results will be helpful for elucidating the functional roles of G4 DNA. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.},

abstract = {Pre-mRNA splicing is regulated through the combinatorial activity of RNA motifs, including splice sites and splicing regulatory elements. Here we show that the activity of the G-run (polyguanine sequence) class of splicing enhancer elements is approximately 4-fold higher when adjacent to intermediate strength 5' splice sites (ss) than when adjacent to weak 5' ss, and approximately 1.3-fold higher relative to strong 5' ss. We observed this dependence on 5' ss strength in both splicing reporters and in global microarray and mRNA-Seq analyses of splicing changes following RNA interference against heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H, which cross-linked to G-runs adjacent to many regulated exons. An exon's responsiveness to changes in hnRNP H levels therefore depends in a complex way on G-run abundance and 5' ss strength. This pattern of activity enables G-runs and hnRNP H to buffer the effects of 5' ss mutations, augmenting both the frequency of 5' ss polymorphism and the evolution of new splicing patterns. Certain other splicing factors may function similarly.},

We present a sequence analysis tool (named uShuffle) for generating uniform random permutations of biological sequences (such as DNAs, RNAs, and proteins) that preserve the exact k-let counts. The uShuffle tool implements the latest variant of the Euler algorithm and uses Wilson's algorithm in the crucial step of arborescence generation. It is carefully engineered and extremely efficient. The uShuffle tool achieves maximum flexibility by allowing arbitrary alphabet size and let size. It can be used as a command-line program, a web application, or a utility library. Source code in C, Java, and C{\#}, and integration instructions for Perl and Python are provided. The uShuffle tool surpasses existing implementation of the Euler algorithm in both performance and flexibility. It is a useful tool for the bioinformatics community.},

abstract = {To determine the prevalence of cotranscriptional splicing in Drosophila, we sequenced nascent RNA transcripts from Drosophila S2 cells as well as from Drosophila heads. Eighty-seven percent of the introns assayed manifest {\textgreater}50{\%} cotranscriptional splicing. The remaining 13{\%} are cotranscriptionally spliced poorly or slowly, with ∼3{\%} being almost completely retained in nascent pre-mRNA. Although individual introns showed slight but statistically significant differences in splicing efficiency, similar global levels of splicing were seen from both sources. Importantly, introns with low cotranscriptional splicing efficiencies are present in the same primary transcript with efficiently spliced introns, indicating that splicing is intron-specific. The analysis also indicates that cotranscriptional splicing is less efficient for first introns, longer introns, and introns annotated as alternative. Finally, S2 cells expressing the slow RpII215(C4) mutant show substantially less intron retention than wild-type S2 cells.},

abstract = {The RNA binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) F is involved in telomeres maintenance and pre-mRNA processing, such as alternative splicing and polyadenylation. It specifically recognizes RNA containing three consecutive guanines (G-tracts) that have the potential to assemble into G-quadruplexes. We have proposed recently that hnRNP F could regulate alternative splicing by remodeling RNA structures, such as G-quadruplexes. However, the exact mechanism of hnRNP F binding to such RNA sequences remains unknown. Here, we have studied the binding of the third RNA binding domain of hnRNP F [quasi-RNA recognition motif 3 (qRRM3)] to G-tract RNA using isothermal titration calorimetry, circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our results show that qRRM3 binds specifically exclusively to single-stranded G-tracts (ssRNA), in contrast to previous reports stating that the G-quadruplex was recognized as well. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the pre-existent ssRNA/G-quadruplex equilibrium slows down the formation of the protein-ssRNA complex. Based on in vitro transcription assays, we show that the rate of the protein-RNA complex formation is faster than that of the G-quadruplex. We propose a model according to which hnRNP F could bind RNA co-transcriptionally and prevents G-quadruplex formation.},

abstract = {Nucleosomes compact and regulate access to DNA in the nucleus, and are composed of approximately 147 bases of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer. Here we report a genome-wide nucleosome positioning analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana using massively parallel sequencing of mononucleosomes. By combining this data with profiles of DNA methylation at single base resolution, we identified 10-base periodicities in the DNA methylation status of nucleosome-bound DNA and found that nucleosomal DNA was more highly methylated than flanking DNA. These results indicate that nucleosome positioning influences DNA methylation patterning throughout the genome and that DNA methyltransferases preferentially target nucleosome-bound DNA. We also observed similar trends in human nucleosomal DNA, indicating that the relationships between nucleosomes and DNA methyltransferases are conserved. Finally, as has been observed in animals, nucleosomes were highly enriched on exons, and preferentially positioned at intron-exon and exon-intron boundaries. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) was also enriched on exons relative to introns, consistent with the hypothesis that nucleosome positioning regulates Pol II processivity. DNA methylation is also enriched on exons, consistent with the targeting of DNA methylation to nucleosomes, and suggesting a role for DNA methylation in exon definition.},

abstract = {The remarkable selectivity of N-Me mesoporphyrin IX (NMM) for G-quadruplexes (GQs) is well-known; however, its ability to stabilize and bind GQs has not been investigated in detail. Through the use of CD, UV-visible spectroscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) melting assay we have shown that NMM stabilizes human telomeric DNA dAG3(TTAG3)3 (Tel22) and is selective for its parallel conformation to which it binds in 1:1 stoichiometry with a binding const. of ∼1.0 × 105 M-1. NMM does not interact with an antiparallel conformation of Tel22 in sodium buffer and is the second example in the literature, after TOxaPy, of a ligand with an excellent selectivity for a specific GQ structure. NMM's stabilizing ability toward predominantly parallel GQ conformation is universal; it stabilizes a variety of biol. relevant G-rich sequences including telomeres and oncogene promoters. The N-Me group is integral for selectivity and stabilization, as the unmethylated analog, mesoporphyrin IX, does not stabilize GQ DNA in FRET melting assays. Finally, NMM induces the isomerization of Tel22 into a structure with increased parallel component in K+ but not in Na+ buffer. The ability of NMM to cause structural rearrangement and efficient stabilization of Tel22 may bear biol. significance. [on SciFinder(R)]},

abstract = {G-quadruplexes are secondary structures present in DNA and RNA molecules, which are formed by stacking of G-quartets (i.e., interaction of four guanines (G-tracts) bounded by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding). Human PAX9 intron 1 has a putative G-quadruplex-forming region located near exon 1, which is present in all known sequenced placental mammals. Using circular dichroism (CD) analysis and CD melting, we showed that these sequences are able to form highly stable quadruplex structures. Due to the proximity of the quadruplex structure to exon-intron boundary, we used a validated double-reporter splicing assay and qPCR to analyze its role on splicing efficiency. The human quadruplex was shown to have a key role on splicing efficiency of PAX9 intron 1, as a mutation that abolished quadruplex formation decreased dramatically the splicing efficiency of human PAX9 intron 1. The less stable, rat quadruplex had a less efficient splicing when compared to human sequences. Additionally, the treatment with 360A, a strong ligand that stabilizes quadruplex structures, further increased splicing efficiency of human PAX9 intron 1. Altogether, these results provide evidences that G-quadruplex structures are involved in splicing efficiency of PAX9 intron 1.},

To determine the RNA-binding profile of Golgi-derived COPI in neuronal cells, we performed formaldehyde-linked RNA immunoprecipitation, followed by high-throughput sequencing, a process we term FLRIP-Seq (FLRIP, formaldehyde-cross-linked immunoprecipitation). We demonstrate that COPa co-immunoprecipitates a specific set of RNAs that are enriched in G-quadruplex motifs and fragile X mental retardation protein-associated RNAs and that encode factors that predominantly localize to the plasma membrane and cytoskeleton and function within signaling pathways.

abstract = {Tandem stretches of guanines can associate in hydrogen-bonded arrays to form G-quadruplexes, which are stabilized by K(+) ions. Using computational methods, we searched for G-Quadruplex Sequence (GQS) patterns in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. We found ∼ 1200 GQS with a G(3) repeat sequence motif, most of which are located in the intergenic region. Using a Markov modeled genome, we determined that GQS are significantly underrepresented in the genome. Additionally, we found ∼ 43,000 GQS with a G(2) repeat sequence motif; notably, 80{\%} of these were located in genic regions, suggesting that these sequences may fold at the RNA level. Gene Ontology functional analysis revealed that GQS are overrepresented in genes encoding proteins of certain functional categories, including enzyme activity. Conversely, GQS are underrepresented in other categories of genes, notably those for non-coding RNAs such as tRNAs and rRNAs. We also find that genes that are differentially regulated by drought are significantly more likely to contain a GQS. CD-detected K(+) titrations performed on representative RNAs verified formation of quadruplexes at physiological K(+) concentrations. Overall, this study indicates that GQS are present at unique locations in Arabidopsis and that folding of RNA GQS may play important roles in regulating gene expression.},

We generated a comprehensive dataset of gene expression from individual cell types of the Arabidopsis root. Comparisons across cell types revealed that alternative splicing tends to remove parts of coding regions from a longer, major isoform, providing evidence for a progressive mechanism of splicing. Cell-type-specific intron retention suggested a possible origin for this common form of alternative splicing. Coordinated alternative splicing across developmental stages pointed to a role in regulating differentiation. Consistent with this hypothesis, distinct isoforms of a transcription factor were shown to control developmental transitions. lincRNAs were generally lowly expressed at the level of individual cell types, but co-expression clusters provided clues as to their function. Our results highlight insights gained from analysis of expression at the level of individual cell types.},

In addition, our results suggest that events leading to the serious growth problems in the absence of DNA TOPO I are linked to R-loop formation. We show that the overexpression of RNase H, an enzyme that degrades the RNA moiety of an R loop, can partially compensate for the absence of DNA TOPO I. We also note that a defect in DNA gyrase can correct several phenotypes associated with a mutation in the rnhA gene, which encodes the major RNase H activity.

@article{Reaban1994,
abstract = {W e previously showed that the in vitro transcription of a negatively supercoiled plasmid containing the mu-rine IgA switch region caused the formation of fewer supercoiled conformers of the plasmid due to the presence of a stable RNA-DNA hybrid. Here, we demonstrate that the RNA-DNA hybrid is approximately 140 nucleotides , and it forms regardless of the initial topological state of the transcription template. Transcription of the switch region in a relaxed closed circular plasmid generates positively supercoiled plasmid conformers that revert to their original relaxed state when treated with RNase H. Conformers that have incorporated a stable RNA transcript are also observed when nicked circular and linear plasmids containing the IgA switch sequences are transcribed with "P-labeled nucleotide triphosphates. Once formed, the RNA-DNA hybrid is stable to both thermal and superhelical stress, tolerating temperatures in excess of 95 "C and restraining approximately 12 positive supercoils in the plasmid. Immunoglobulin class switching is mediated by recombina-tion between two DNA sequences called switch regions located 3' of the variable region and 5' of the new constant region that will be expressed. These sequences are associated with conserved transcription promoters. Transcriptional activity has been correlated with increased recombination rates in such diverse systems as the immunoglobulin variable region assembly process (1) and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAL 10 locus (2). Transcription may also play an important role in immuno-globulin class switch recombination, because the specific switch regions where the DNA recombination will occur become tran-scriptionally active immediately prior t o class switching (3). Transcription might enhance recombination via several mechanisms. First, transcription may serve to "open up" the transcribed DNA to make it more accessible to the recombination machinery. Second, it may transiently generate positively and negatively supercoiled domains in the transcribed DNA (4-6) affecting both structural transitions and interactions between DNA and other molecules that contribute t o recombination. Third, the transcription just prior to switch recombination also generates "sterile transcripts," and our data suggest that these transcripts may participate directly in the formation of a re-combination intermediate. The switch region located 5' of murine IgA constant region contains an (AGGAG),, repeat that displays supercoil-dependent sensitivity to single-strand specific reagents. The reactivity pattern that we observed in a shorter repeat, (AGGAG),GA, was consistent with the formation of a pyrpur'pyr intramo-lecular triplex (7). When we transcribed the switch region-containing plasmid, pBS-(rS2.3, with T7 RNA polymerase in the same direction as transcription occurs in vivo prior to switch recombination, a stable RNA.DNA hybrid was generated. Formation of this hybrid structure relaxed negatively supercoiled plasmids, generating a ladder of less supercoiled plasmid conformers that were not generated when the opposite strand of pBS-aS2.3 was transcribed with T3 RNA polymerase (8, 9). The stretch of polypurine-polypyrimidine sequences in which this RNA.DNA hybrid structure forms is known to have the ability to form a variety of interesting alternative structures. Under appropriate in uitro conditions, pyr.pur.pyr (10, 11) or pyr.pur.pur (12, 13) co-linear triplexes, pyr.pur.pyr (14) or pyr.pur.pur (15) intramolecular triplexes, or fused double tri-plex structures (16) have been shown to form. Polypurine-poly-pyrimidine stretches occur more frequently in eukaryotic DNA than can be explained by random distribution, and they are frequently found in regions associated with gene regulation or DNA recombination (17). Examples include the human c-myc (12, 18) and murine metallothionein-I (19) gene regulatory regions , a factor binding region of the chicken p-globin locus (201, the site of an unequal sister chromatid exchange in a myeloma cell line (21), and the murine IgA switch region (71, all of which have been shown capable of adopting alternative structures in uitro. These observations, together with data presented in this article , begin to reveal some insight into the mechanism of im-munoglobulin switch recombination. They suggest the possibility that the transcription of switch regions, which precedes DNA rearrangement, leads to the synthesis of RNA transcripts that become an integral part of the recombination intermediate structure.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Most analyses of microarray data are based on point estimates of expression levels and ignore the uncertainty of such estimates. By determining uncertainties from Affymetrix GeneChip data and propagating these uncertainties to downstream analyses it has been shown that we can improve results of differential expression detection, principal component analysis and clustering. Previously, implementations of these uncertainty propagation methods have only been available as separate packages, written in different languages. Previous implementations have also suffered from being very costly to compute, and in the case of differential expression detection, have been limited in the experimental designs to which they can be applied.RESULTS:puma is a Bioconductor package incorporating a suite of analysis methods for use on Affymetrix GeneChip data. puma extends the differential expression detection methods of previous work from the 2-class case to the multi-factorial case. puma can be used to automatically create design and contrast matrices for typical experimental designs, which can be used both within the package itself but also in other Bioconductor packages. The implementation of differential expression detection methods has been parallelised leading to significant decreases in processing time on a range of computer architectures. puma incorporates the first R implementation of an uncertainty propagation version of principal component analysis, and an implementation of a clustering method based on uncertainty propagation. All of these techniques are brought together in a single, easy-to-use package with clear, task-based documentation.CONCLUSION:For the first time, the puma package makes a suite of uncertainty propagation methods available to a general audience. These methods can be used to improve results from more traditional analyses of microarray data. puma also offers improvements in terms of scope and speed of execution over previously available methods. puma is recommended for anyone working with the Affymetrix GeneChip platform for gene expression analysis and can also be applied more generally.},

Potential G4 quadruplex sequences have been identified in G-rich eukaryotic non-telomeric and telomeric genomic regions. Upon function, G4 formation is known to involve in chromatin remodeling, gene regulation and has been associated with genomic instability, genetic diseases and cancer progression. The natural role and biological validation of G4 structures is starting to be explored, and is of particular interest for the therapeutic interventions for human diseases. However, the existence and physiological role of G4 DNA and G4 RNA in plants species have not been much investigated yet and therefore, is of great interest for the development of improved crop varieties for sustainable agriculture. In this context, several recent studies suggests that these highly diverse G4 structures in plants can be employed to regulate expression of genes involved in several pathophysiological conditions including stress response to biotic and abiotic stresses as well as DNA damage. In the current review, we summarize the recent findings regarding the emerging functional significance of G4 structures in plants and discuss their potential value in the development of improved crop varieties.},

RNA G4s have recently been shown to exist in human cells and be biologically significant. Described herein is a new approach to detect and map RNA G4s in cellular transcripts. This method exploits the specific control of RNA G4-cation and RNA G4-ligand interactions during reverse transcription, by using a selective reverse transcriptase to monitor RNA G4-mediated reverse transcriptase stalling (RTS) events. Importantly, a ligation-amplification strategy is coupled with RTS, and enables detection and mapping of G4s in important, low-abundance cellular RNAs.

abstract = {Motivation G-quadruplexes (G4s) are one of the non-B DNA structures easily observed in vitro and assumed to form in vivo. The latest experiments with G4-specific antibodies and G4-unwinding helicase mutants confirm this conjecture. These four-stranded structures have also been shown to influence a range of molecular processes in cells. As G4s are intensively studied, it is often desirable to screen DNA sequences and pinpoint the precise locations where they might form. Results We describe and have tested a newly developed Bioconductor package for identifying potential quadruplex-forming sequences (PQS). The package is easy-to-use, flexible and customizable. It allows for sequence searches that accommodate possible divergences from the optimal G4 base composition. A novel aspect of our research was the creation and training (parametrization) of an advanced scoring model which resulted in increased precision compared to similar tools. We demonstrate that the algorithm behind the searches has a 96{\%} accuracy on 392 currently known and experimentally observed G4 structures. We also carried out searches against the recent G4-seq data to verify how well we can identify the structures detected by that technology. The correlation with pqsfinder predictions was 0.622, higher than the correlation 0.491 obtained with the second best G4Hunter.

@article{Parsyan2011,
abstract = {The translation initiation step in eukaryotes is highly regulated and rate-limiting. During this process, the 40S ribosomal subunit is usually recruited to the 5' terminus of the mRNA. It then migrates towards the initiation codon, where it is joined by the 60S ribosomal subunit to form the 80S initiation complex. Secondary structures in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) can impede binding and movement of the 40S ribosome. The canonical eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4A (also known as DDX2), together with its accessory proteins eIF4B and eIF4H, is thought to act as a helicase that unwinds secondary structures in the mRNA 5' UTR. Growing evidence suggests that other helicases are also important for translation initiation and may promote the scanning processivity of the 40S subunit, synergize with eIF4A to 'melt' secondary structures or facilitate translation of a subset of mRNAs.},

abstract = {G-quadruplex (G4) can be formed by G-rich DNA sequences that are widely distributed throughout the human genome. Although G-triplex and G-hairpin have been proposed as G4 folding intermediates, their formation still requires further investigation by experiments. Here, we employed single-molecule FRET to characterize the folding dynamics of G4 from human telomeric sequence. First, we observed four states during G4 folding initially assigned to be anti-parallel G4, G-triplex, G-hairpin and unfolded ssDNA. Then we constructed putative intra-strand G-triplex, G-hairpin structures and confirmed their existences in both NaCl and KCl. Further studies revealed those structures are going through dynamic transitions between different states and show relatively weak dependence on cations, unlike G4. Based on those results and molecular dynamics simulations, we proposed a multi-pathway folding mechanism for human telomeric G4. The present work may shed new light on our current understanding about the existence and stability of G4 intermediate states.},

abstract = {In this review, we give an overview of recent literature on the structure and stability of unimolecular G-rich quadruplex structures that are relevant to drug design and for in vivo function. The unifying theme in this review is energetics. The thermodynamic stability of quadruplexes has not been studied in the same detail as DNA and RNA duplexes, and there are important differences in the balance of forces between these classes of folded oligonucleotides. We provide an overview of the principles of stability and where available the experimental data that report on these principles. Significant gaps in the literature have been identified, that should be filled by a systematic study of well-defined quadruplexes not only to provide the basic understanding of stability both for design purposes, but also as it relates to in vivo occurrence of quadruplexes. Techniques that are commonly applied to the determination of the structure, stability and folding are discussed in terms of information content and limitations. Quadruplex structures fold and unfold comparatively slowly, and DNA unwinding events associated with transcription and replication may be operating far from equilibrium. The kinetics of formation and resolution of quadruplexes, and methodologies are discussed in the context of stability and their possible biological occurrence.},

abstract = {RNA structure has critical roles in processes ranging from ligand sensing to the regulation of translation, polyadenylation and splicing. However, a lack of genome-wide in vivo RNA structural data has limited our understanding of how RNA structure regulates gene expression in living cells. Here we present a high-throughput, genome-wide in vivo RNA structure probing method, structure-seq, in which dimethyl sulphate methylation of unprotected adenines and cytosines is identified by next-generation sequencing. Application of this method to Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings yielded the first in vivo genome-wide RNA structure map at nucleotide resolution for any organism, with quantitative structural information across more than 10,000 transcripts. Our analysis reveals a three-nucleotide periodic repeat pattern in the structure of coding regions, as well as a less-structured region immediately upstream of the start codon, and shows that these features are strongly correlated with translation efficiency. We also find patterns of strong and weak secondary structure at sites of alternative polyadenylation, as well as strong secondary structure at 5' splice sites that correlates with unspliced events. Notably, in vivo structures of messenger RNAs annotated for stress responses are poorly predicted in silico, whereas mRNA structures of genes related to cell function maintenance are well predicted. Global comparison of several structural features between these two categories shows that the mRNAs associated with stress responses tend to have more single-strandedness, longer maximal loop length and higher free energy per nucleotide, features that may allow these RNAs to undergo conformational changes in response to environmental conditions. Structure-seq allows the RNA structurome and its biological roles to be interrogated on a genome-wide scale and should be applicable to any organism.},

abstract = {Changes in RNA conformation can alter gene expression. The guanine quadruplex sequence (GQS) is an RNA motif that folds in the presence of K(+) ions. Changes in the conformation of this motif could be especially important in regulating gene expression in plants because intracellular K(+) concentrations often increase during drought stress. Little is known about the folding thermodynamics of RNA GQS. We show here that RNA GQS with tracts containing three G's [e.g., (GGGxx)(4)] have a modest dependence on the K(+) concentration, folding with no or even negative cooperativity (Hill coefficients ≤1), and are associated with populated folding intermediates. In contrast, GQS with tracts containing just two G's [e.g., (GGxx)(4)] have a steep dependence on the K(+) concentration and fold with positive cooperativity (Hill coefficients of 1.7-2.7) without significantly populating intermediate states. We postulate that in plants, the more stable G3 sequences are largely folded even under unstressed conditions, while the less stable G2 sequences fold only at the higher K(+) concentrations associated with cellular stress, wherein they respond sharply to changing K(+) concentrations. Given the binary nature of their folding, G2 sequences may find application in computation with DNA and in engineering of genetic circuits.},

abstract = {G-quadruplex (G4) is a DNA secondary structure that has been found to play regulatory roles in the genome. The identification of G4-forming sequences is important to study the specific structure-function relationships of such regions. In the present study, we developed a method for identification of G4 clusters on genomic DNA by high-throughput sequencing of genomic DNA amplified via whole-genome amplification (WGA) in the presence of a G4 ligand. The G4 ligand specifically bound to G4 structures on genomic DNA; thus, DNA polymerase was arrested on the G4 structures stabilised by G4 ligand. We utilised the telomestatin derivative L1H1-7OTD as a G4 ligand and demonstrated that the efficiency of amplification of the G4 cluster regions was lower than that of the non-G4-forming regions. By high-throughput sequencing of the WGA products, 9,651 G4 clusters were identified on human genomic DNA. Among these clusters, 3,766 G4 clusters contained at least one transcriptional start site, suggesting that genes are regulated by G4 clusters rather than by one G4 structure.},

Thus, it is not surprising that upon of deregulation of those molecular machines healthy cells can turn into cancerous cells. Even though the remodeling enzymes are very abundant and a multitude of different enzymes and chromatin remodeling complexes exist in the cell, the particular remodeling complex with its specific nucleosome positioning features must be at the right place at the right time in order to ensure the proper regulation of the DNA dependent processes. To achieve this, chromatin remodeling complexes harbor protein domains that specifically read chromatin targeting signals, such as histone modifications, DNA sequence/structure, non-coding RNAs, histone variants or DNA bound interacting proteins. Recent studies reveal the interaction between non-coding RNAs and chromatin remodeling complexes showing importance of RNA in remodeling enzyme targeting, scaffolding and regulation. In this review, we summarize current understanding of chromatin remodeling enzyme targeting to chromatin and their role in cancer development.},

abstract = {SR proteins constitute a family of pre-mRNA splicing factors now thought to play several roles in mRNA metabolism in metazoan cells. Here we provide evidence that a prototypical SR protein, ASF/SF2, is unexpectedly required for maintenance of genomic stability. We first show that in vivo depletion of ASF/SF2 results in a hypermutation phenotype likely due to DNA rearrangements, reflected in the rapid appearance of DNA double-strand breaks and high-molecular-weight DNA fragments. Analysis of DNA from ASF/SF2-depleted cells revealed that the nontemplate strand of a transcribed gene was single stranded due to formation of an RNA:DNA hybrid, R loop structure. Stable overexpression of RNase H suppressed the DNA-fragmentation and hypermutation phenotypes. Indicative of a direct role, ASF/SF2 prevented R loop formation in a reconstituted in vitro transcription reaction. Our results support a model by which recruitment of ASF/SF2 to nascent transcripts by RNA polymerase II prevents formation of mutagenic R loop structures.

The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C.  Python is also suitable as an extension language for highly customizable C applications such as editors or window managers. Python is available for various operating systems, amongst which several flavors of UNIX, Amoeba, the Apple Macintosh O.S., and MS-DOS. This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system.  It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but as the examples are self-contained, the tutorial can be read off-line as well.

abstract = {Splicing remains an incompletely understood process. Recent findings suggest that chromatin structure participates in its regulation. Here, we analyze the RNA from subcellular fractions obtained through RNA-seq in the cell line K562. We show that in the human genome, splicing occurs predominantly during transcription. We introduce the coSI measure, based on RNA-seq reads mapping to exon junctions and borders, to assess the degree of splicing completion around internal exons. We show that, as expected, splicing is almost fully completed in cytosolic polyA+ RNA. In chromatin-associated RNA (which includes the RNA that is being transcribed), for 5.6{\%} of exons, the removal of the surrounding introns is fully completed, compared with 0.3{\%} of exons for which no intron-removal has occurred. The remaining exons exist as a mixture of spliced and fewer unspliced molecules, with a median coSI of 0.75. Thus, most RNAs undergo splicing while being transcribed: "co-transcriptional splicing." Consistent with co-transcriptional spliceosome assembly and splicing, we have found significant enrichment of spliceosomal snRNAs in chromatin-associated RNA compared with other cellular RNA fractions and other nonspliceosomal snRNAs. CoSI scores decrease along the gene, pointing to a "first transcribed, first spliced" rule, yet more downstream exons carry other characteristics, favoring rapid, co-transcriptional intron removal. Exons with low coSI values, that is, in the process of being spliced, are enriched with chromatin marks, consistent with a role for chromatin in splicing during transcription. For alternative exons and long noncoding RNAs, splicing tends to occur later, and the latter might remain unspliced in some cases.},

abstract = {Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a mediator of aggressive phenotype in pancreatic cancer. On the basis of our finding that knockdown of either KRAS or ILK has a reciprocal effect on the other's expression, we hypothesized the presence of an ILK-KRAS regulatory loop that enables pancreatic cancer cells to regulate KRAS expression. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which this regulatory circuitry is regulated and to investigate the translational potential of targeting ILK to suppress oncogenic KRAS signaling in pancreatic cancer. Interplay between KRAS and ILK and the roles of E2F1, c-Myc and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein as intermediary effectors in this feedback loop was interrogated by genetic manipulations through small interfering RNA/short hairpin RNA knockdown and ectopic expression, western blotting, PCR, promoter-luciferase reporter assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation and pull-down analyses. In vivo efficacy of ILK inhibition was evaluated in two murine xenograft models. Our data show that KRAS regulated the expression of ILK through E2F1-mediated transcriptional activation, which, in turn, controlled KRAS gene expression via hnRNPA1-mediated destabilization of the G-quadruplex on the KRAS promoter. Moreover, ILK inhibition blocked KRAS-driven epithelial–mesenchymal transition and growth factor-stimulated KRAS expression. The knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of ILK suppressed pancreatic tumor growth, in part, by suppressing KRAS signaling. These studies suggest that this KRAS-E2F1-ILK-hnRNPA1 regulatory loop enables pancreatic cancer cells to promote oncogenic KRAS signaling and to interact with the tumor microenvironment to promote aggressive phenotypes. This regulatory loop provides a mechanistic rationale for targeting ILK to suppress oncogenic KRAS signaling, which might foster new therapeutic strategies for pancreatic cancer.},

abstract = {Read alignment is an ongoing challenge for the analysis of data from sequencing technologies. This article proposes an elegantly simple multi-seed strategy, called seed-and-vote, for mapping reads to a reference genome. The new strategy chooses the mapped genomic location for the read directly from the seeds. It uses a relatively large number of short seeds (called subreads) extracted from each read and allows all the seeds to vote on the optimal location. When the read length is {\textless}160 bp, overlapping subreads are used. More conventional alignment algorithms are then used to fill in detailed mismatch and indel information between the subreads that make up the winning voting block. The strategy is fast because the overall genomic location has already been chosen before the detailed alignment is done. It is sensitive because no individual subread is required to map exactly, nor are individual subreads constrained to map close by other subreads. It is accurate because the final location must be supported by several different subreads. The strategy extends easily to find exon junctions, by locating reads that contain sets of subreads mapping to different exons of the same gene. It scales up efficiently for longer reads.},

By coimmunofluorescence, ATRX localizes with a mouse homologue of the Drosophila heterochromatic protein HP1 in vivo, consistent with a previous two-hybrid screen identifying this interaction. From the analysis of a trap assay for nuclear proteins, we have shown that the localization of ATRX to heterochromatin is encoded by its N-terminal region, which contains a conserved plant homeodomain-like finger and a coiled-coil domain. In addition to its association with heterochromatin, at metaphase ATRX clearly binds to the short arms of human acrocentric chromosomes, where the arrays of ribosomal DNA are located. The unexpected association of a putative transcriptional regulator with highly repetitive DNA provides a potential explanation for the variability in phenotype of patients with identical mutations in the ATRX gene.},

abstract = {Understanding the nature of DNA replication origins in metazoan is quite challenging. In the absence of a genetic assay like in yeast, methods were devised based on the DNA structure, the visualization or quantification of the first nascent strands that are synthesized at origins, or on the localization of origin binding proteins. The purification and quantification of RNA-primed nascent DNA at origins during initiation of DNA synthesis is the most exhaustive and precise method to map active replication origins at present. We have upgraded this method to the level of reproducibility and enrichment required for genome-wide analyses by microarrays or deep sequencing. We detail here the protocol and the controls required at the different steps. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {G-quadruplex structures formed in the telomeric DNA are thought to play a role in the telomere function. Drugs that stabilize the G-quadruplexes were shown to have anticancer effects. The structures formed by the basic telomeric quadruplex-forming unit G(3)(TTAG(3))(3) were the subject of multiple studies. Here, we employ (125)I-radioprobing, a method based on analysis of the distribution of DNA breaks after decay of (125)I incorporated into one of the nucleotides, to determine the fold of the telomeric DNA in the presence of TMPyP4 and telomestatin, G-quadruplex-binding ligands and putative anticancer drugs. We show that d[G(3)(TTAG(3))(3)(125)I-CT] adopts basket conformation in the presence of NaCl and that addition of either of the drugs does not change this conformation of the quadruplex. In KCl, the d[G(3)(TTAG(3))(3)(125)I-CT] is most likely present as a mixture of two or more conformations, but addition of the drugs stabilize the basket conformation. We also show that d[G(3)(TTAG(3))(3)(125)I-CT] with a 5'-flanking sequence folds into (3+1) type 2 conformation in KCl, while in NaCl it adopts a novel (3+1) basket conformation with a diagonal central loop. The results demonstrate the structural flexibility of the human telomeric DNA; and show how cations, quadruplex-binding drugs and flanking sequences can affect the conformation of the telomeric quadruplex.},

abstract = {RNA structure is a primary determinant of its function, and methods that merge chemical probing with next generation sequencing have created breakthroughs in the throughput and scale of RNA structure characterization. However, little work has been done to examine the effects of library preparation and sequencing on the measured chemical probe reactivities that encode RNA structural information. Here, we present the first analysis and optimization of these effects for selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension sequencing (SHAPE-Seq). We first optimize SHAPE-Seq, and show that it provides highly reproducible reactivity data over a wide range of RNA structural contexts with no apparent biases. As part of this optimization, we present SHAPE-Seq v2.0, a 'universal' method that can obtain reactivity information for every nucleotide of an RNA without having to use or introduce a specific reverse transcriptase priming site within the RNA. We show that SHAPE-Seq v2.0 is highly reproducible, with reactivity data that can be used as constraints in RNA folding algorithms to predict structures on par with those generated using data from other SHAPE methods. We anticipate SHAPE-Seq v2.0 to be broadly applicable to understanding the RNA sequence-structure relationship at the heart of some of life's most fundamental processes.},

The volume and complexity of data from RNA-seq experiments necessitate scalable, fast and mathematically principled analysis software. TopHat and Cufflinks are free, open-source software tools for gene discovery and comprehensive expression analysis of high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Together, they allow biologists to identify new genes and new splice variants of known ones, as well as compare gene and transcript expression under two or more conditions. This protocol describes in detail how to use TopHat and Cufflinks to perform such analyses. It also covers several accessory tools and utilities that aid in managing data, including CummeRbund, a tool for visualizing RNA-seq analysis results. Although the procedure assumes basic informatics skills, these tools assume little to no background with RNA-seq analysis and are meant for novices and experts alike. The protocol begins with raw sequencing reads and produces a transcriptome assembly, lists of differentially expressed and regulated genes and transcripts, and publication-quality visualizations of analysis results. The protocol's execution time depends on the volume of transcriptome sequencing data and available computing resources but takes less than 1 d of computer time for typical experiments and ∼1 h of hands-on time.},

abstract = {The G-quadruplex (G4) elements comprise a class of nucleic acid structures formed by stacking of guanine base quartets in a quadruple helix. This G4 DNA can form within or across single-stranded DNA molecules and is mutually exclusive with duplex B-form DNA. The reversibility and structural diversity of G4s make them highly versatile genetic structures, as demonstrated by their roles in various functions including telomere metabolism, genome maintenance, immunoglobulin gene diversification, transcription, and translation. Sequence motifs capable of forming G4 DNA are typically located in telomere repeat DNA and other non-telomeric genomic loci. To investigate their potential roles in a large-genome model plant species, we computationally identified 149,988 non-telomeric G4 motifs in maize (Zea mays L., B73 AGPv2), 29{\%} of which were in non-repetitive genomic regions. G4 motif hotspots exhibited non-random enrichment in genes at two locations on the antisense strand, one in the 5' UTR and the other at the 5' end of the first intron. Several genic G4 motifs were shown to adopt sequence-specific and potassium-dependent G4 DNA structures invitro. The G4 motifs were prevalent in key regulatory genes associated with hypoxia (group VII ERFs), oxidative stress (DJ-1/GATase1), and energy status (AMPK/SnRK) pathways. They also showed statistical enrichment for genes in metabolic pathways that function in glycolysis, sugar degradation, inositol metabolism, and base excision repair. Collectively, the maize G4 motifs may represent conditional regulatory elements that can aid in energy status gene responses. Such a network of elements could provide a mechanistic basis for linking energy status signals to gene regulation in maize, a model genetic system and major world crop species for feed, food, and fuel.},

Likewise, recruitment of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) to S regions is critical for CSR; however, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that intronic switch RNA acts in trans to target AID to S region DNA. AID binds directly to switch RNA through G-quadruplexes formed by the RNA molecules. Disruption of this interaction by mutation of a key residue in the putative RNA-binding domain of AID impairs recruitment of AID to S region DNA, thereby abolishing CSR. Additionally, inhibition of RNA lariat processing leads to loss of AID localization to S regions and compromises CSR; both defects can be rescued by exogenous expression of switch transcripts in a sequence-specific manner. These studies uncover an RNA-mediated mechanism of targeting AID to DNA.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) diversifies transcriptomes and proteomes and is widely recognized as a key mechanism for regulating gene expression. Previously, in an analysis of intron retention events in Arabidopsis, we found unusual AS events inside annotated protein-coding exons. Here, we also identify such AS events in human and use these two sets to analyse their features, regulation, functional impact, and evolutionary origin. As these events involve introns with features of both introns and protein-coding exons, we name them exitrons (exonic introns). Though exitrons were detected as a subset of retained introns, they are clearly distinguishable, and their splicing results in transcripts with different fates. About half of the 1002 Arabidopsis and 923 human exitrons have sizes of multiples of 3 nucleotides (nt). Splicing of these exitrons results in internally deleted proteins and affects protein domains, disordered regions, and various post-translational modification sites, thus broadly impacting protein function. Exitron splicing is regulated across tissues, in response to stress and in carcinogenesis. Intriguingly, annotated intronless genes can be also alternatively spliced via exitron usage. We demonstrate that at least some exitrons originate from ancestral coding exons. Based on our findings, we propose a "splicing memory" hypothesis whereby upon intron loss imprints of former exon borders defined by vestigial splicing regulatory elements could drive the evolution of exitron splicing. Altogether, our studies show that exitron splicing is a conserved strategy for increasing proteome plasticity in plants and animals, complementing the repertoire of AS events.},

A chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis of the DNA damage marker gammaH2AX provided the genome-wide distribution of pyridostatin-induced sites of damage and revealed that pyridostatin targets gene bodies containing clusters of sequences with a propensity for G-quadruplex formation. As a result, pyridostatin modulated the expression of these genes, including the proto-oncogene SRC. We observed that pyridostatin reduced SRC protein abundance and SRC-dependent cellular motility in human breast cancer cells, validating SRC as a target of this drug.

abstract = {In metazoans, thousands of DNA replication origins (Oris) are activated at each cell cycle. Their genomic organization and their genetic nature remain elusive. Here, we characterized Oris by nascent strand (NS) purification and a genome-wide analysis in Drosophila and mouse cells. We show that in both species most CpG islands (CGI) contain Oris, although methylation is nearly absent in Drosophila, indicating that this epigenetic mark is not crucial for defining the activated origin. Initiation of DNA synthesis starts at the borders of CGI, resulting in a striking bimodal distribution of NS, suggestive of a dual initiation event. Oris contain a unique nucleotide skew around NS peaks, characterized by G/T and C/A overrepresentation at the 5' and 3' of Ori sites, respectively. Repeated GC-rich elements were detected, which are good predictors of Oris, suggesting that common sequence features are part of metazoan Oris. In the heterochromatic chromosome 4 of Drosophila, Oris correlated with HP1 binding sites. At the chromosome level, regions rich in Oris are early replicating, whereas Ori-poor regions are late replicating. The genome-wide analysis was coupled with a DNA combing analysis to unravel the organization of Oris. The results indicate that Oris are in a large excess, but their activation does not occur at random. They are organized in groups of site-specific but flexible origins that define replicons, where a single origin is activated in each replicon. This organization provides both site specificity and Ori firing flexibility in each replicon, allowing possible adaptation to environmental cues and cell fates.},

For all cells tested, {\textgreater}80{\%} of the telomeres have long G-rich overhangs, averaging 130-210 bases in length, in disagreement with the conventional model for incomplete lagging-strand replication, which predicts overhangs on 50{\%} of the chromosome ends. The observed G tails must exist during most of the cell cycle and probably result from degradation of both chromosome ends. The average lengths of the G tails are quantitatively consistent with the observed rates of human chromosome shortening.},

abstract = {PRIMARY cell walls contain a protein, extensin, which is rich in trans 4-L-hydroxyproline1–3. I suggested earlier that this protein could cross link wall polysaccharides4; if some of these cross linkages were labile, it would provide a chemical basis for changes in cell wall plasticity which are necessary for extension of plant cells. The recent isolation of several glycopeptides, rich in hydroxyproline from enzymatic digests of tomato cell walls5, confirmed the inference of a covalent carbohydrate–protein linkage in extensin. The chemical composition and properties of these glycopeptides also led me to the preliminary conclusion that attachment of the carbohydrate is by a glycosidic link through the hydroxyl group of hydroxyproline5. This rather unexpected possibility receives additional support from results presented in this communication, describing the isolation of hydroxyproline-O-glycosides from partial alkaline hydrolysates of tomato cell walls. These cell wall preparations account for more than 95 per cent of the hydroxyproline of the cells3. Most of this hydroxyproline (about 70 per cent) can be released as hydroxyproline glycosides. The method is based on the fact that glycosidic linkages are usually stable to those alkaline conditions which lead to rapid hydrolysis of peptide bonds6.},

Such structures readily form from the guanine-rich repeat sequences found in telomeres, the physical ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. We present a solid-state NMR approach for studying ions associated with G-quartets based on the direct NMR observation of 23Na+ ion resonances and report new methods for studying quadrupolar nuclei in biological solids. In the tetraplex forming oligonucleotide d(TG4T), high-field (17.6 T) NMR spectra cleanly resolve three distinct classes of sodium ions. A high-resolution 2D-MQMAS spectrum established the assignment of an amorphously broadened signal at -19 ppm (relative to 0.1 M NaCl) to surface-bound Na+ ions. Two-dimensional nutation spectroscopy was used to indicate the relative size of the quadrupole coupling for each line, while a standard exchange experiment established a correlation between surface (-19 ppm) and channel-bound (6.8 ppm) Na+ ions. Finally, free sodium ions are observed at 0 ppm. This work demonstrates the utility of high field spectroscopy in combination with a suite of 2D solid-state NMR experiments for resolving and assigning multiple Na+ sites in [d(TG4T)]4.},

Also, genomic regions that impose structural barriers to the DNA replication fork are a potential source of genetic instability [2, 3]. Here, we demonstrate that G4 DNA—a sequence motif that folds into quadruplex structures in vitro [4, 5]—is highly mutagenic in vivo and is removed from genomes that lack dog-1, the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian FANCJ [6, 7], which is mutated in Fanconi anemia patients [8–11]. We show that sequences that match the G4 DNA signature G3-5N1-3G3-5N1-3G3-5N1-3G3-5 are deleted in germ and somatic tissues of dog-1 animals. Unbiased aCGH analyses of dog-1 genomes that were allowed to accumulate mutations in {\textgreater}100 replication cycles indicate that deletions are found exclusively at G4 DNA; deletion frequencies can reach 4{\%} per site per animal generation. We found that deletion sizes fall short of Okazaki fragment lengths [12], and no significant microhomology was observed at deletion junctions. The existence of 376,000 potentially mutagenic G4 DNA sites in the human genome could have major implications for the etiology of hereditary FancJ and nonhereditary cancers.},

However, searching for overlaps between features with existing web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner. RESULTS This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets.

@article{Hummel2010,
abstract = {Growth and carbon (C) fluxes are severely altered in plants exposed to soil water deficit. Correspondingly, it has been suggested that plants under water deficit suffer from C shortage. In this study, we test this hypothesis in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) by providing an overview of the responses of growth, C balance, metabolites, enzymes of the central metabolism, and a set of sugar-responsive genes to a sustained soil water deficit. The results show that under drought, rosette relative expansion rate is decreased more than photosynthesis, leading to a more positive C balance, while root growth is promoted. Several soluble metabolites accumulate in response to soil water deficit, with K(+) and organic acids as the main contributors to osmotic adjustment. Osmotic adjustment costs only a small percentage of the daily photosynthetic C fixation. All C metabolites measured (not only starch and sugars but also organic acids and amino acids) show a diurnal turnover that often increased under water deficit, suggesting that these metabolites are readily available for being metabolized in situ or exported to roots. On the basis of 30 enzyme activities, no in-depth reprogramming of C metabolism was observed. Water deficit induces a shift of the expression level of a set of sugar-responsive genes that is indicative of increased, rather than decreased, C availability. These results converge to show that the differential impact of soil water deficit on photosynthesis and rosette expansion results in an increased availability of C for the roots, an increased turnover of C metabolites, and a low-cost C-based osmotic adjustment, and these responses are performed without major reformatting of the primary metabolism machinery.},

In this study, whether or not G4 structures' presence in the 3' UTRs of mRNAs can hinder miRNA binding was investigated. Putative G4 overlapping with predicted miRNAs' binding sites was searched for, and 44,294 hits were found in humans. The FADS2 mRNA/mir331-3p pair was selected as a model example. In-line probing and G4-specific fluorescent ligand experiments binding were performed and confirmed the presence of a G4 near the predicted miRNA binding site. Subsequent luciferase assays showed that the presence of the G4 prevents the binding of mir331-3p in cellulo. Together, these results served as proof of concept that a G4 structure present in a 3' UTR sequence should be taken into consideration when predicting miRNA binding sites.},

Here we report an in-depth analysis of 15 diverse human tissue and cell line transcriptomes on the basis of deep sequencing of complementary DNA fragments, yielding a digital inventory of gene and mRNA isoform expression. Analyses in which sequence reads are mapped to exon-exon junctions indicated that 92-94{\%} of human genes undergo alternative splicing, 86{\%} with a minor isoform frequency of 15{\%} or more. Differences in isoform-specific read densities indicated that most alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation events vary between tissues, whereas variation between individuals was approximately twofold to threefold less common. Extreme or 'switch-like' regulation of splicing between tissues was associated with increased sequence conservation in regulatory regions and with generation of full-length open reading frames. Patterns of alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation were strongly correlated across tissues, suggesting coordinated regulation of these processes, and sequence conservation of a subset of known regulatory motifs in both alternative introns and 3' untranslated regions suggested common involvement of specific factors in tissue-level regulation of both splicing and polyadenylation.},

Telomestatin bound to plant telomeric repeat sequence, and inhibited telomerase activity in suspension-cultured cells of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa (rice) in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitor did not affect transcript level of the TERT gene, which encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, in the plant cells. Inhibition of telomerase activity by telomestatin resulted in rapid shortening of telomeres and the induction of cell death by an apoptosis-like mechanism in Arabidopsis cells. These results suggest that telomerase contributes to the survival of proliferating plant cells by maintaining telomere length, and that telomere erosion triggers cell death. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Alternative splicing of precursor mRNA is an essential mechanism to increase the complexity of gene expression, and it plays an important role in cellular differentiation and organism development. Regulation of alternative splicing is a complicated process in which numerous interacting components are at work, including cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors, and is further guided by the functional coupling between transcription and splicing. Additional molecular features, such as chromatin structure, RNA structure and alternative transcription initiation or alternative transcription termination, collaborate with these basic components to generate the protein diversity due to alternative splicing. All these factors contributing to this one fundamental biological process add up to a mechanism that is critical to the proper functioning of cells. Any corruption of the process may lead to disruption of normal cellular function and the eventuality of disease. Cancer is one of those diseases, where alternative splicing may be the basis for the identification of novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as new strategies for therapy. Thus, an in-depth understanding of alternative splicing regulation has the potential not only to elucidate fundamental biological principles, but to provide solutions for various diseases.},

abstract = {$\beta$-Site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the transmembrane aspartyl protease that catalyzes the first cleavage step in the proteolysis of the APP to the amyloid $\beta$-protein (A$\beta$), a process involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. BACE1 pre-mRNA undergoes complex alternative splicing, the regulation of which is not well understood. We identified a G-rich sequence within exon 3 of BACE1 involved in controlling splice site selection. Mutation of the G-rich sequence decreased use of the normal 5' splice site of exon 3, which leads to full-length and proteolytically active BACE1, and increased use of an alternative splice site, which leads to a shorter, essentially inactive isoform. Nuclease protection assays, nuclear magnetic resonance, and circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that this sequence folds into a G-quadruplex structure. Several proteins were identified as capable of binding to the G-rich sequence, and one of these, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H, was found to regulate BACE1 exon 3 alternative splicing and in a manner dependent on the G-rich sequence. Knockdown of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H led to a decrease in the full-length BACE1 mRNA isoform as well as a decrease in A$\beta$ production from APP, suggesting new possibilities for therapeutic approaches to Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Bcl-x is a member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins that are key regulators of apoptosis. The Bcl-x pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced to yield Bcl-x(S) and Bcl-x(L), two isoforms that have been associated, respectively, with the promotion and the prevention of apoptosis. We have investigated some of the elements and factors involved in the production of these two splice variants. Deletion mutagenesis using a human Bcl-x minigene identifies two regions in exon 2 that modulate Bcl-x 5'-splice site selection in human HeLa cells. One region (B3) is located upstream of the Bcl-x(L) 5'-splice site and enforces Bcl-x(L) production in cells and splicing extracts. The other region (B2) is located immediately downstream of the 5'-splice site of Bcl-x(S) and favors Bcl-x(S) production in vivo and in vitro. A 30-nucleotide G-rich element (B2G) is responsible for the activity of the B2 element. We show that recombinant heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) F and H proteins bind to B2G, and mutating the G stretches abolishes binding. Moreover, the addition of hnRNP F to a HeLa extract improved the production of the Bcl-x(S) variant in a manner that was dependent on the integrity of the G stretches in B2G. Consistent with the in vitro results, small interfering RNA-mediated RNA interference targeting hnRNP F and H decreased the Bcl-x(S)/Bcl-x(L) ratio of plasmid-derived and endogenously produced Bcl-x transcripts. Our results document a positive role for the hnRNP F/H proteins in the production of the proapoptotic regulator Bcl-x(S.).},

abstract = {The 484-nucleotide (nt) alternatively translated region (ATR) of the human fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) mRNA contains four CUG and one AUG translation initiation codons. Although the 5'-end proximal CUG codon is initiated by a cap-dependent translation process, the other four initiation codons are initiated by a mechanism of internal entry of ribosomes. We undertook here a detailed analysis of the cis-acting elements defining the FGF-2 internal ribosome entry site (IRES). A thorough deletion analysis study within the 5'-ATR led us to define a 176-nt region as being necessary and sufficient for IRES function at four codons present in a downstream 308-nt RNA segment. Unexpectedly, a single IRES module is therefore responsible for translation initiation at four distantly localized codons. The determination of the FGF-2 5'-ATR RNA secondary structure by enzymatic and chemical probing experiments showed that the FGF-2 IRES contained two stem-loop regions and a G quartet motif that constitute novel structural determinants of IRES function.},

Histones, the chief protein component of chromatin, must be assembled, replaced or exchanged to preserve or change this organization according to cellular needs. Histone chaperones are key actors during histone metabolism. Here we classify known histone chaperones and discuss how they build a network to escort histone proteins. Molecular interactions with histones and their potential specificity or redundancy are also discussed in light of chaperone structural properties. The multiplicity of histone chaperone partners, including histone modifiers, nucleosome remodelers and cell-cycle regulators, is relevant to their coordination with key cellular processes. Given the current interest in chromatin as a source of epigenetic marks, we address the potential contributions of histone chaperones to epigenetic memory and genome stability.},

All guanines participate in the formation of the G-tetrad core, despite the interruption between the first guanine and the next two guanines by a thymine, which forms a single-residue bulge and is projected out of the G-tetrad core. To provide a more general understanding about the formation of bulges within G-quadruplexes, we systematically investigated the effects of the residue type, the size, the position, and the number of bulges on the structure and stability of G-quadruplexes.

abstract = {Genomic DNA base composition (GC content) is predicted to significantly affect genome functioning and species ecology. Although several hypotheses have been put forward to address the biological impact of GC content variation in microbial and vertebrate organisms, the biological significance of GC content diversity in plants remains unclear because of a lack of sufficiently robust genomic data. Using flow cytometry, we report genomic GC contents for 239 species representing 70 of 78 monocot families and compare them with genomic characters, a suite of life history traits and climatic niche data using phylogeny-based statistics. GC content of monocots varied between 33.6{\%} and 48.9{\%}, with several groups exceeding the GC content known for any other vascular plant group, highlighting their unusual genome architecture and organization. GC content showed a quadratic relationship with genome size, with the decreases in GC content in larger genomes possibly being a consequence of the higher biochemical costs of GC base synthesis. Dramatic decreases in GC content were observed in species with holocentric chromosomes, whereas increased GC content was documented in species able to grow in seasonally cold and/or dry climates, possibly indicating an advantage of GC-rich DNA during cell freezing and desiccation. We also show that genomic adaptations associated with changing GC content might have played a significant role in the evolution of the Earth's contemporary biota, such as the rise of grass-dominated biomes during the mid-Tertiary. One of the major selective advantages of GC-rich DNA is hypothesized to be facilitating more complex gene regulation.},

abstract = {ATRX is an X-linked gene of the SWI/SNF family, mutations in which cause syndromal mental retardation and downregulation of $\alpha$-globin expression. Here we show that ATRX binds to tandem repeat (TR) sequences in both telomeres and euchromatin. Genes associated with these TRs can be dysregulated when ATRX is mutated, and the change in expression is determined by the size of the TR, producing skewed allelic expression. This reveals the characteristics of the affected genes, explains the variable phenotypes seen with identical ATRX mutations, and illustrates a new mechanism underlying variable penetrance. Many of the TRs are G rich and predicted to form non-B DNA structures (including G-quadruplex) in vivo. We show that ATRX binds G-quadruplex structures in vitro, suggesting a mechanism by which ATRX may play a role in various nuclear processes and how this is perturbed when ATRX is mutated.

This motif confers the ability to form an unusual four-stranded DNA structure, G4 DNA. G4 DNA is associated with genomic instability, which may explain depletion of G4 motifs from some genes and genomic regions. Conversely, G4 motifs are enriched downstream of transcription start sites, where they correlate with pausing. The uneven distribution of G4 motifs in the genome strongly suggests that mechanisms of selection act not only on one-dimensional genomic sequence, but also on structures formed by genomic DNA. The biological roles of G4 structures illustrate that, to understand genome function, it is important to consider the dynamic structural potential implicit in the G4 motif.},

abstract = {Extensins (EXTs) are a family of plant cell wall hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGPs) that are implicated to play important roles in plant growth, development, and defense. Structurally, EXTs are characterized by the repeated occurrence of serine (Ser) followed by three to five prolines (Pro) residues, which are hydroxylated as hydroxyproline (Hyp) and glycosylated. Some EXTs have Tyrosine (Tyr)-X-Tyr (where X can be any amino acid) motifs that are responsible for intramolecular or intermolecular cross-linkings. EXTs can be divided into several classes: classical EXTs, short EXTs, leucine-rich repeat extensins (LRXs), proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinases (PERKs), formin-homolog EXTs (FH EXTs), chimeric EXTs, and long chimeric EXTs. To guide future research on the EXTs and understand evolutionary history of EXTs in the plant kingdom, a bioinformatics study was conducted to identify and classify EXTs from 16 fully sequenced plant genomes, including Ostreococcus lucimarinus, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Volvox carteri, Klebsormidium flaccidum, Physcomitrella patens, Selaginella moellendorffii, Pinus taeda, Picea abies, Brachypodium distachyon, Zea mays, Oryza sativa, Glycine max, Medicago truncatula, Brassica rapa, Solanum lycopersicum, and Solanum tuberosum, to supplement data previously obtained from Arabidopsis thaliana and Populus trichocarpa. A total of 758 EXTs were newly identified, including 87 classical EXTs, 97 short EXTs, 61 LRXs, 75 PERKs, 54 FH EXTs, 38 long chimeric EXTs, and 346 other chimeric EXTs. Several notable findings were made: (1) classical EXTs were likely derived after the terrestrialization of plants; (2) LRXs, PERKs, and FHs were derived earlier than classical EXTs; (3) monocots have few classical EXTs; (4) Eudicots have the greatest number of classical EXTs and Tyr-X-Tyr cross-linking motifs are predominantly in classical EXTs; (5) green algae have no classical EXTs but have a number of long chimeric EXTs that are absent in embryophytes. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis was conducted of LRXs, PERKs and FH EXTs, which shed light on the evolution of three EXT classes.},

Tracts of tandem guanines, for instance, have the potential to adopt stable G-quadruplex structures, which are prone to cause genome alterations. Here we describe G4 DNA-induced mutagenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans and identify a non-canonical DNA break repair mechanism that generates deletions characterized by an extremely narrow size distribution, minimal homology of exactly one nucleotide at the junctions, and by the occasional presence of templated insertions. This typical mutation profile is fully dependent on the A-family polymerase Theta, the absence of which leads to profound loss of sequences surrounding G4 motifs. Theta-mediated end-joining prevails over non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination and prevents genomic havoc at replication fork barriers at the expense of small deletions. G4 DNA-induced deletions also manifest in the genomes of wild isolates of C. elegans, indicating a protective role for this pathway during evolution.},

abstract = {The human bcl-2 gene contains a GC-rich region upstream of the P1 promoter that has been shown to be critically involved in the regulation of bcl-2 gene expression. We have demonstrated that the guanine-rich strand of the DNA in this region can form any one of three distinct intramolecular G-quadruplex structures. Mutation and deletion analysis permitted isolation and identification of three overlapping DNA sequences within this element that formed the three individual G-quadruplexes. Each of these was characterized using nondenaturing gel analysis, DMS footprinting, and circular dichroism. The central G-quadruplex, which is the most stable, forms a mixed parallel/antiparallel structure consisting of three tetrads connected by loops of one, seven, and three bases. Three different G-quadruplex-interactive agents were found to further stabilize these structures, with individual selectivity toward one or more of these G-quadruplexes. Collectively, these results suggest that the multiple G-quadruplexes identified in the promoter region of the bcl-2 gene are likely to play a similar role to the G-quadruplexes in the c-myc promoter in that their formation could serve to modulate gene transcription. Last, we demonstrate that the complexity of the G-quadruplexes in the bcl-2 promoter extends beyond the ability to form any one of three separate G-quadruplexes to each having the capacity to form either three or six different loop isomers. These results are discussed in relation to the biological significance of this G-quadruplex-forming element in modulation of bcl-2 gene expression and the inherent complexity of the system where different G-quadruplexes and loop isomers are possible.},

abstract = {DNA telomeric repeats in mammalian cells are transcribed to guanine-rich RNA sequences, which adopt parallel-stranded G-quadruplexes with a propeller-like fold. The successful crystallization and structure analysis of a bimolecular human telomeric RNA G-quadruplex, folded into the same crystalline environment as an equivalent DNA oligonucleotide sequence, is reported here. The structural basis of the increased stability of RNA telomeric quadruplexes over DNA ones and their preference for parallel topologies is described here. Our findings suggest that the 2'-OH hydroxyl groups in the RNA quadruplex play a significant role in redefining hydration structure in the grooves and the hydrogen bonding networks. The preference for specific nucleotides to populate the C3'-endo sugar pucker domain is accommodated by alterations in the phosphate backbone, which leads to greater stability through enhanced hydrogen bonding networks. Molecular dynamics simulations on the DNA and RNA quadruplexes are consistent with these findings. The computations, based on the native crystal structure, provide an explanation for RNA G-quadruplex ligand binding selectivity for a group of naphthalene diimide ligands as compared to the DNA G-quadruplex.},

We count the number of quadruplexes found in the human genome and compare that with the figure predicted by modelling DNA as a Bernoulli stream or as a Markov chain, using windows of various sizes. We demonstrate that the distribution of loop lengths is significantly different from what would be expected in a random case, providing an indication of the number of potentially relevant quadruplex-forming sequences. In particular, we show that there is a significant repression of quadruplexes in the coding strand of exonic regions, which suggests that quadruplex-forming patterns are disfavoured in sequences that will form RNA.},

abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

abstract = {G-quadruplexes are believed to be potential targets for therapeutic intervention and this has resulted in designing of various quadruplex interacting ligands. Moreover, reports about existence of quadruplex forming sequences across the genome have propelled greater interest in understanding their interaction with small molecules. An intramolecular quadruplex sequence can adopt different conformations, owing to different orientation of loops in the structure. The differences in the loop orientation can affect their molecular recognition. Herein, we have studied the interaction of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridyl)-21H, 23H-porphine (TMPyP4), a well-known G quadruplex binding ligand with three DNA quadruplexes differing in loop orientations. Results obtained from UV, ITC, and SPR studies have coherently revealed that the TMPyP4 molecule shows preferential binding to parallel G-quadruplex ( c-myc and c-kit) over its antiparallel counterpart (human telomeric). The binding affinity for parallel quadruplex was (10(7)) 1 order of magnitude higher than that for antiparallel DNA quadruplex (10 ). The study shows two binding modes, stronger binding (10(7)) of TMPyP4 involving end stacking and a weaker external binding (10 ), while TMPyP4 shows only one binding mode with duplex with a binding affinity of the order of 10(6). Overall, the study emphasizes that differences in the loop orientation give rise to different conformations of quadruplex, which in turn govern its binding to small molecules, and thereby play a pivotal role in molecular recognition.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) is a key regulatory mechanism that contributes to transcriptome and proteome diversity. As very few genome-wide studies analyzing AS in plants are available, we have performed high-throughput sequencing of a normalized cDNA library which resulted in a high coverage transcriptome map of Arabidopsis. We detect ∼150,000 splice junctions derived mostly from typical plant introns, including an eightfold increase in the number of U12 introns (2069). Around 61{\%} of multiexonic genes are alternatively spliced under normal growth conditions. Moreover, we provide experimental validation of 540 AS transcripts (from 256 genes coding for important regulatory factors) using high-resolution RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Intron retention (IR) is the most frequent AS event (∼40{\%}), but many IRs have relatively low read coverage and are less well-represented in assembled transcripts. Additionally, ∼51{\%} of Arabidopsis genes produce AS transcripts which do not involve IR. Therefore, the significance of IR in generating transcript diversity was generally overestimated in previous assessments. IR analysis allowed the identification of a large set of cryptic introns inside annotated coding exons. Importantly, a significant fraction of these cryptic introns are spliced out in frame, indicating a role in protein diversity. Furthermore, we show extensive AS coupled to nonsense-mediated decay in AFC2, encoding a highly conserved LAMMER kinase which phosphorylates splicing factors, thus establishing a complex loop in AS regulation. We provide the most comprehensive analysis of AS to date which will serve as a valuable resource for the plant community to study transcriptome complexity and gene regulation.},

@article{Sundquist1989,
abstract = {The telomeric ends of eukaryotic chromosomes are composed of simple repeating sequences in which one DNA strand contains short tracts of guanine residues alternating with short tracts of A/T-rich sequences. The guanine-rich strand is always oriented in a 5'-3' direction towards the end of the chromosome and is extended to produce a 3' overhang of about two repeating units in species where the telomeric terminus is known. This overhang has been implicated in the formation of several unusual intra-and intermolecular DNA structures, although none of these structures has been characterized fully. We now report that oligonucleotides encoding Tetrahymena telomeres dimerize to form stable complexes in solution. This salt-dependent dimerization is mediated entirely by the 3'-terminal telomeric overhang (TT-GGGGTTGGGG) and produces complexes in which the N7 position of every guanine in the overhangs is chemically inaccessible. We therefore propose that telomeric DNA dimerizes by hydrogen bonding between two intramolecular hairpin loops, to form antiparallel quadruplexes containing cyclic guanine base tetrads. These novel hairpin dimers may be important in telomere association and recombination and could also provide a general mechanism for pairing two double helices in other recombinational processes.},

abstract = {BLM and WRN, the products of the Bloom's and Werner's syndrome genes, are members of the RecQ family of DNA helicases. Although both have been shown previously to unwind simple, partial duplex DNA substrates with 3'--{\textgreater}5' polarity, little is known about the structural features of DNA that determine the substrate specificities of these enzymes. We have compared the substrate specificities of the BLM and WRN proteins using a variety of partial duplex DNA molecules, which are based upon a common core nucleotide sequence. We show that neither BLM nor WRN is capable of unwinding duplex DNA from a blunt-ended terminus or from an internal nick. However, both enzymes efficiently unwind the same blunt-ended duplex containing a centrally located 12 nt single-stranded 'bubble', as well as a synthetic X-structure (a model for the Holliday junction recombination intermediate) in which each 'arm' of the 4-way junction is blunt-ended. Surprisingly, a 3'-tailed duplex, a standard substrate for 3'--{\textgreater}5' helicases, is unwound much less efficiently by BLM and WRN than are the bubble and X-structure substrates. These data show conclusively that a single-stranded 3'-tail is not a structural requirement for unwinding of standard B-form DNA by these helicases. BLM and WRN also both unwind a variety of different forms of G-quadruplex DNA, a structure that can form at guanine-rich sequences present at several genomic loci. Our data indicate that BLM and WRN are atypical helicases that are highly DNA structure specific and have similar substrate specificities. We interpret these data in the light of the genomic instability and hyper-recombination characteristics of cells from individuals with Bloom's or Werner's syndrome.},

abstract = {Although well studied in vitro, the in vivo functions of G-quadruplexes (G4-DNA and G4-RNA) are only beginning to be defined. Recent studies have demonstrated enrichment for sequences with intramolecular G-quadruplex forming potential (QFP) in transcriptional promoters of humans, chickens and bacteria. Here we survey the yeast genome for QFP sequences and similarly find strong enrichment for these sequences in upstream promoter regions, as well as weaker but significant enrichment in open reading frames (ORFs). Further, four findings are consistent with roles for QFP sequences in transcriptional regulation. First, QFP is correlated with upstream promoter regions with low histone occupancy. Second, treatment of cells with N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMM), which binds G-quadruplexes selectively in vitro, causes significant upregulation of loci with QFP-possessing promoters or ORFs. NMM also causes downregulation of loci connected with the function of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA), which itself has high QFP. Third, ORFs with QFP are selectively downregulated in sgs1 mutants that lack the G4-DNA-unwinding helicase Sgs1p. Fourth, a screen for yeast mutants that enhance or suppress growth inhibition by NMM revealed enrichment for chromatin and transcriptional regulators, as well as telomere maintenance factors. These findings raise the possibility that QFP sequences form bona fide G-quadruplexes in vivo and thus regulate transcription.},

abstract = {DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) initiate extensive local and global alterations in chromatin structure, many of which depend on the ATM kinase. Histone H2A ubiquitylation (uH2A) on chromatin surrounding DSBs is one example, thought to be important for recruitment of repair proteins. uH2A is also implicated in transcriptional repression; an intriguing yet untested hypothesis is that this function is conserved in the context of DSBs. Using a novel reporter that allows for visualization of repair protein recruitment and local transcription in single cells, we describe an ATM-dependent transcriptional silencing program in cis to DSBs. ATM prevents RNA polymerase II elongation-dependent chromatin decondensation at regions distal to DSBs. Silencing is partially dependent on E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF8 and RNF168, whereas reversal of silencing relies on the uH2A deubiquitylating enzyme USP16. These findings give insight into the role of posttranslational modifications in mediating crosstalk between diverse processes occurring on chromatin. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {REV1-deficient chicken DT40 cells are compromised in replicating G quadruplex (G4)-forming DNA. This results in localised, stochastic loss of parental chromatin marks and changes in gene expression. We previously proposed that this epigenetic instability arises from G4-induced replication fork stalls disrupting the accurate propaga-tion of chromatin structure through replication. Here, we test this model by showing that a single G4 motif is responsible for the epigenetic instability of the BU-1 locus in REV1-deficient cells, despite its location 3.5 kb from the transcription start site (TSS). The effect of the G4 is dependent on it residing on the leading strand template, but is independent of its in vitro thermal stability. Moving the motif to more than 4 kb from the TSS stabilises expression of the gene. However, loss of histone modifications (H3K4me3 and H3K9/14ac) around the transcription start site correlates with the position of the G4 motif, expression being lost only when the promoter is affected. This supports the idea that processive replication is required to maintain the histone modifica-tion pattern and full transcription of this model locus.},

abstract = {Class switch recombination (CSR) at the immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) locus is associated with the formation of R-loop structures over switch (S) regions. While these often occur co-transcriptionally between nascent RNA and template DNA, we now show that they also form as part of a post-transcriptional mechanism targeting AID to IgH S-regions. This depends on the RNA helicase DDX1 that is also required for CSR in vivo. DDX1 binds to G-quadruplex (G4) structures present in intronic switch transcripts and converts them into S-region R-loops. This in turn targets the cytidine deaminase enzyme AID to S-regions so promoting CSR. Notably R-loop levels over S-regions are diminished by chemical stabilization of G4 RNA or by the expression of a DDX1 ATPase-deficient mutant that acts as a dominant-negative protein to reduce CSR efficiency. In effect, we provide evidence for how S-region transcripts interconvert between G4 and R-loop structures to promote CSR in the IgH locus. Ribeiro de Almeida and colleagues demonstrate that the RNA helicase DDX1 is required for IgH class switch recombination. DDX1 binds to G-quadruplex structures present in switch long non-coding RNA and promotes R-loop formation over S-region DNA, thereby targeting AID to the IgH locus.},

In total, in the 10 species we discussed, the PGQMs densities in monocots were higher than dicots. 40,483 and 31,795 PGQMs were identified with a density of 108.46 and 84.89 PGQMs/Mb, respectively, in japonica and indica genomes, 10,655 and 5420 loci were found to contain at least one PGQM in their gene bodies (with a percentage of 19{\%} and 14{\%}) indicating a wide distribution of G-quadruplex motifs in O. sativa genome. They preferred to locate in transcription start sites proximal regions and 5′-UTR with relative high enrichment. This phenomenon supports the hypothesis that PGQMs are involved in gene transcription and translation. In addition, we analyzed the distribution of different loop length in G-quadruplex and found the density of long loop PGQMs was less than short loop in indica's intron but it was similar in japonica. Meanwhile, we focused on the loci with PGQMs and conducted gene ontology (GO) analysis of them. As a result, many GO terms were identified and significantly correlated with the loci containing at least one PGQM. The GO analysis in the two subspecies of rice may be helpful for elucidating the functional roles of G-quadruplexes.},

abstract = {The tumor suppressor gene TP53, encoding p53, is expressed as several transcripts. The fully spliced p53 (FSp53) transcript encodes the canonical p53 protein. The alternatively spliced p53I2 transcript retains intron 2 and encodes $\Delta$40p53 (or $\Delta$Np53), an isoform lacking first 39 N-terminal residues corresponding to the main transactivation domain. We demonstrate the formation of G-quadruplex structures (G4) in a GC-rich region of intron 3 that modulates the splicing of intron 2. First, we show the formation of G4 in synthetic RNAs encompassing intron 3 sequences by ultraviolet melting, thermal difference spectra and circular dichroism spectroscopy. These observations are confirmed by detection of G4-induced reverse transcriptase elongation stops in synthetic RNA of intron 3. In this region, p53 pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) contains a succession of short exons (exons 2 and 3) and introns (introns 2 and 4) covering a total of 333 bp. Site-directed mutagenesis of G-tracts putatively involved in G4 formation decreased by {\~{}}30{\%} the excision of intron 2 in a green fluorescent protein-reporter splicing assay. Moreover, treatment of lymphoblastoid cells with 360A, a synthetic ligand that binds to single-strand G4 structures, increases the formation of FSp53 mRNA and decreases p53I2 mRNA expression. These results indicate that G4 structures in intron 3 regulate the splicing of intron 2, leading to differential expression of transcripts encoding distinct p53 isoforms.},

abstract = {RNA structures in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs influence post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Much of the knowledge in this area depends on canonical double-stranded RNA elements. There has been considerable recent advancement of our understanding of guanine(G)-rich nucleic acids sequences that form four-stranded structures, called G-quadruplexes. While much of the research has been focused on DNA G-quadruplexes, there has recently been a rapid emergence of interest in RNA G-quadruplexes, particularly in the 5'-UTRs of mRNAs. Collectively, these studies suggest that RNA G-quadruplexes exist in the 5'-UTRs of many genes, including genes of clinical interest, and that such structural elements can influence translation. This review features the progresses in the study of 5'-UTR RNA G-quadruplex-mediated translational control. It covers computational analysis, cell-free, cell-based and chemical biology studies that have sought to elucidate the roles of RNA G-quadruplexes in both cap-dependent and -independent regulation of mRNA translation. We also discuss protein trans-acting factors that have been implicated and the evidence that such RNA motifs have potential as small molecule target. Finally, we close the review with a perspective on the future challenges in the field of 5'-UTR RNA G-quadruplex-mediated translation regulation.},

abstract = {Telomestatin is a natural product isolated from Streptomyces anulatus 3533-SV4 and has been shown to be a very potent telomerase inhibitor. The structural similarity between telomestatin and a G-tetrad suggested to us that the telomerase inhibition might be due to its ability either to facilitate the formation of or trap out preformed G-quadruplex structures, and thereby sequester single-stranded d[T(2)AG(3)](n) primer molecules required for telomerase activity. Significantly, telomestatin appears to be a more potent inhibitor of telomerase (5 nM) than any of the previously described G-quadruplex-interactive molecules. In this communication we provide the first experimental evidence that telomestatin selectively facilitates the formation of or stabilizes intramolecular G-quadruplexes, in particular, that produced from the human telomeric sequence d[T(2)AG(3)](4). A simulated annealing (SA) docking approach was used to study the binding interactions of telomestatin with the intramolecular antiparallel G-quadruplex structure. Each intramolecular G-quadruplex molecule was found to bind two telomestatin molecules (unpublished results). A 2:1 model for the telomestatin bound in the external stacking mode in an energy minimized complex with the human telomeric basket-type G-quadruplex was constructed. Our observation that a G-quadruplex-interactive molecule without significant groove interactions is able to reorient in a G-quadruplex structure proints to the importance of core interaction with an asymmetric G-quadruplex structure in producing selective binding. Furthermore, the G-quadruplex interactions of telomestatin are more selective for the intramolecular structure in contrast to other G-quadruplex-interactive agents, such as TMPyP4.},

Detection of SCEs typically requires cells to incorporate bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) during two rounds of DNA synthesis. Previous studies have suggested that SCEs are induced by DNA replication over BrdU-substituted DNA and that BrdU incorporation alone could be responsible for the high number of SCE events observed in cells from patients with Bloom syndrome (BS), a rare genetic disorder characterized by marked genome instability and high SCE frequency. Here we show using Strand-seq, a single cell DNA template strand sequencing technique, that the presence of variable BrdU concentrations in the cell culture medium and in DNA template strands has no effect on SCE frequency in either normal or BS cells. We conclude that BrdU does not induce SCEs and that SCEs detected in either normal or BS cells reflect DNA repair events that occur spontaneously.},

Our analyses also show that initiation of DNA synthesis takes place precisely at 160 bp (Drosophila) and 280 bp (mouse) from the OGRE. We also found that in most CpG islands, an OGRE is positioned in opposite orientation on each of the two DNA strands and detected two sites of initiation of DNA synthesis upstream or downstream of each OGRE. Conversely, Oris not associated with CpG islands have a single initiation site. OGRE density along chromosomes correlated with previously published replication timing data. Ori sequences centered on the OGRE are also predicted to have high intrinsic nucleosome occupancy. Finally, OGREs predict G-quadruplex structures at Oris that might be structural elements controlling the choice or activation of replication origins.},

The four cytidine stretches form an i-motif which includes six intercalated C{\'{A}}C  pairs and terminates with the cytidines at the 5 H extremity of each stretch. Above, the second TA 2 linker loops across one of the narrow grooves, while at the bottom, the {\textregistered}rst and third linkers loop across the wide grooves. At 30 C, the spectra of the {\textregistered}rst and third linkers are quasi-degenerate. Severe broadening at lower temperature indicates that this results from motional averaging between at least two structures of each bottom loop, and makes it impossible to solve the con{\textregistered}guration of the bottom loops directly, in contrast to the rest of the structure. We therefore turned to the modi{\textregistered}ed sequence d(CCCTA 2 5mCCC-TA 2 CCCUA 2 CCCT) in which the two base substitutions (underlined) break the quasi-symmetry between linkers 1 and 3. The three loops follow approximately the hairpin``hairpin``second pattern'' of Hilbers. In the {\textregistered}rst loop, T4 is in the syn orientation, whereas its analog in the third loop, U16, oriented anti, is in a central location, where it interacts with bases of both loops, thus contributing to their tight association. The only motion is a syn/anti ¯ip of A18 in the third loop. Returning to the telomere fragment, we show that each of the bottom loops switches between the structures identi{\textregistered}ed in the {\textregistered}rst and third loops of the modi{\textregistered}ed structure. The motions are concerted, and the resulting con{\textregistered}gurations of the bottom loop cluster present a bulge to either right (T4 syn) or left (T16 syn).},

Hybrid and chimeric versions of HRGP molecules also exist. In order to "mine" genomic databases for HRGPs and to facilitate and guide research in the field, the BIO OHIO software program was developed that identifies and classifies AGPs, EXTs, PRPs, hybrid HRGPs, and chimeric HRGPs from proteins predicted from DNA sequence data. This bioinformatics program is based on searching for biased amino acid compositions and for particular protein motifs associated with known HRGPs. HRGPs identified by the program are subsequently analyzed to elucidate the following: (1) repeating amino acid sequences, (2) signal peptide and glycosylphosphatidylinositol lipid anchor addition sequences, (3) similar HRGPs via Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, (4) expression patterns of their genes, (5) other HRGPs, glycosyl transferase, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, and peroxidase genes coexpressed with their genes, and (6) gene structure and whether genetic mutants exist in their genes.

abstract = {Approximately 45{\%} of sporadic well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors harbor mutations in either ATRX (alpha thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked) or DAXX (death domain-associated protein). These novel tumor suppressor genes encode nuclear proteins that interact with one another and function in chromatin remodeling at telomeric and peri-centromeric regions. Mutations in these genes are associated with loss of their protein expression and correlate with the alternative lengthening of telomeres phenotype. Patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia-1 (MEN-1) syndrome, genetically defined by a germ line mutation in the MEN1 gene, are predisposed to developing pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and thus represent a unique model for studying the timing of ATRX and DAXX inactivation in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor development. We characterized ATRX and DAXX protein expression by immunohistochemistry and telomere status by telomere-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization in 109 well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine lesions from 28 MEN-1 syndrome patients. The study consisted of 47 neuroendocrine microadenomas ({\textless}0.5 cm), 50 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (≥0.5 cm), and 12 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor lymph node metastases. Expression of ATRX and DAXX was intact in all 47 microadenomas, and none showed the alternative lengthening of telomeres phenotype. ATRX and/or DAXX expression was lost in 3 of 50 (6{\%}) pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. In all three of these, tumor size was ≥3 cm, and loss of ATRX and/or DAXX expression correlated with the alternative lengthening of telomeres phenotype. Concurrent lymph node metastases were present for two of the three tumors, and each metastasis displayed the same changes as the primary tumor. These findings establish the existence of ATRX and DAXX defects and the alternative lengthening of telomeres phenotype in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in the context of MEN-1 syndrome. The observation that ATRX and DAXX defects and the alternative lengthening of telomeres phenotype occurred only in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors measuring ≥3 cm and their lymph node metastases suggests that these changes are late events in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor development.},

abstract = {In 1981 three northern European families were described in which a severely mentally retarded son also had haemoglobin H (Hb H) disease.' These findings were of interest because Hb H disease, a relatively severe manifestation of a thalassaemia, is rare in northern Europeans although it is frequently seen in Mediterranean and Oriental racial groups in which it is not known to be associated with an increased frequency of mental retardation. Further-more, whereas the common forms of Hb H disease are always inherited in a mendelian fashion, in these northern European families this appeared not to be so. Hb H disease occurs when a greater than 50{\%} reduction in synthesis of the a globin chains of adult haemoglobin (Hb A, a212) results in the accumula-tion of excess 1 globin chains which form 14 tetramers (Hb H). The common mendelian forms of Hb H disease result from mutations of both allelic a globin complexes, most commonly owing to dele-tions or less frequently to small rearrangements or point mutations. The a globin complex is located close to the telomere of the short arm of chromo-some 16, within band 16pl3.3. By 1990, a total of 13 subjects with a thalassaemia and mental retardation (ATR) had been identified and two distinct syndromes were delineated.34 Eight patients had large (1 to 2 megabases) deletions of the tip of chromosome 16p; the clinical features of this so called ATR-16 syndrome were rather variable, in},

The results show that the cleavage site is situated between two highly structured domains. The upstream domain consists of two large hairpins, whereas the downstream domain is guanosine-rich. The guanosine-rich domain adopts a compact unimolecular conformation in Na+ or K+ but not in Li+, and it completely arrests reverse transcription in K+ but only partially in Na+, indicating the presence of an intramolecular guanosine quadruplex. The flanking higher-order structures may ensure that the cleavage site is not sequestered in stable RNA structures, thus allowing interactions with RNA or proteins at posttranscriptional stages of IGF-II expression.},

abstract = {Plants are used as representative reference biota for the biological assessment of environmental risks such as ionizing radiation due to their immobility. This study proposed a faster, more economical, and more effective method than conventional cytogenetic methods for the biological dosimetry of ionizing radiation in plants (phytodosimetry). We compared various dose-response curves for the radiation-induced DNA damage response (DDR) in Arabidopsis thaliana after relatively “low-dose” gamma irradiation (3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 Gy) below tens of Gy using comet (or single-cell gel electrophoresis), gamma-H2AX, and transcriptomic assays of seven DDR genes (AGO2, BRCA1, GRG, PARP1, RAD17, RAD51, and RPA1E) using quantitative real time PCR. The DDR signal from the comet assay was saturated at 6 Gy, while the gamma-H2AX signal increased up to 48 Gy, following a linear-quadratic dose-response model. The transcriptional changes in the seven DDR genes were fitted to linear or supra-linear quadratic equations with significant dose-dependency. The dose-dependent transcriptional changes were maintained similarly until 24 h after irradiation. The integrated transcriptional dose-response model of AGO2, BRCA1, GRG, and PARP1 was very similar to that of gamma-H2AX, while the transcriptional changes in the BRCA1, GRG, and PARP1 DDR genes revealed significant dependency on the dose-rate, ecotype, and radiation dose. These results suggest that the transcriptome-based dose-response model fitted to a quadratic equation could be used practically for phytodosimetry instead of conventional cytogenetic models, such as the comet and gamma-H2AX assays. The effects of dose-rate and ecotype on the transcriptional changes of DDR genes should also be considered to improve the transcriptome-based phytodosimetry model.},

Search algorithms of AS forms in a variety of Arabidopsis databases showed they contained an unusually high fraction of retained introns (above 30{\%}), compared with 10{\%} that was reported for humans. The preponderance of retained introns (65{\%}) were either part of open reading frames, present in the UTR region or present as the last intron in the transcript, indicating that their occurrence would not participate in non-sense-mediated decay. Interestingly, the functional distribution of the transcripts with retained introns is skewed towards stress and external/internal stimuli-related functions. A sampling of the alternative transcripts with retained introns were confirmed by RT-PCR and were shown to co-purify with polyribosomes, indicating their nuclear export. Thus, retained introns are a prominent feature of AS in Arabidopsis and as such may play a regulatory function.},

Most of these elements remain protected from CpG methylation, a prevalent epigenetic modification associated with transcriptional silencing.

Using innovative genomics methodologies, we show that transcription through regions of GC skew leads to the formation of long R loop structures. Furthermore, we show that GC skew and R loop formation potential is correlated with and predictive of the unmethylated state of CGIs. Finally, we provide evidence that R loop formation protects from DNMT3B1, the primary de novo DNA methyltransferase in early development. Altogether, these results suggest that protection from DNA methylation is a built-in characteristic of the DNA sequence of CGI promoters that is revealed by the cotranscriptional formation of R loop structures. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc..},

We suggest that apparently-different regulatory motifs including enhancers, silencers, insulators, barriers, and boundaries act similarly - they are active promoters that tether target genes close to, or distant from, appropriate transcription sites or 'factories'. We also suggest that any active transcription unit regulates the firing of its neighbors - and thus can be categorized as one or other type of motif; this is consistent with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) being widely dispersed.},

We next found that mutations in the helicase motifs III (T469A) and VI (Q638A) that inhibit XPB helicase activity preserve the NER function of TFIIH. Our results suggest a mechanism in which the helicase activity of XPB is not used for the opening and repair of damaged DNA, which is instead only driven by its ATPase activity, in combination with the helicase activity of XPD. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

It is one of the most subtle and pervasive forces of molecular evolution, yet, establishing the underlying causes for its idiosyncratic behaviour across living kingdoms has proven elusive to researchers over the past 20 years. In this study, a statistical model for measuring translational selection in any given genome is developed, and the test is applied to 126 fully sequenced genomes, ranging from archaea to eukaryotes. It is shown that tRNA gene redundancy and genome size are interacting forces that ultimately determine the action of translational selection, and that an optimal genome size exists for which this kind of selection is maximal. Accordingly, genome size also presents upper and lower boundaries beyond which selection on codon usage is not possible. We propose a model where the coevolution of genome size and tRNA genes explains the observed patterns in translational selection in all living organisms. This model finally unifies our understanding of codon usage across prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Helicobacter pylori, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens are codon usage paradigms that can be better understood under the proposed model.},

Metabolic tagging of newly transcribed RNA by 4-thiouridine (4sU) can reveal the relative contributions of RNA synthesis and decay rates. The kinetics of RNA processing, however, had so far remained unresolved. Here, we show that ultrashort 4sU-tagging not only provides snapshot pictures of eukaryotic gene expression but, when combined with progressive 4sU-tagging and RNA-seq, reveals global RNA processing kinetics at nucleotide resolution. Using this method, we identified classes of rapidly and slowly spliced/degraded introns. Interestingly, each class of splicing kinetics was characterized by a distinct association with intron length, gene length, and splice site strength. For a large group of introns, we also observed long lasting retention in the primary transcript, but efficient secondary splicing or degradation at later time points. Finally, we show that processing of most, but not all small nucleolar (sno)RNA-containing introns is remarkably inefficient with the majority of introns being spliced and degraded rather than processed into mature snoRNAs. In summary, our study yields unparalleled insights into the kinetics of RNA processing and provides the tools to study molecular mechanisms of RNA processing and their contribution to the regulation of gene expression.},

The resulting series of less supercoiled plasmids is stabilized by RNA-DNA hybrids formed by the nascent RNA transcripts, which remain base-paired with their DNA templates.},

abstract = {In human and mouse, the promoter of the KRAS gene contains a nuclease hypersensitive polypurine-polypyrimidine element (NHPPE) that is essential for transcription. An interesting feature of the polypurine G-rich strand of NHPPE is its ability to assume an unusual DNA structure that, according to circular dichroism (CD) and DMS footprinting experiments, is attributed to an intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex, consisting of three G-tetrads and three loops. The human and mouse KRAS NHPPE G-rich strands display melting temperature of 64 and 73 degrees C, respectively, as well as a K+-dependent capacity to arrest DNA polymerase. Photocleavage and CD experiments showed that the cationic porphyrin TMPyP4 stacks to the external G-tetrads of the KRAS quadruplexes, increasing the T(m) by approximately 20 degrees C. These findings raise the intriguing question that the G-quadruplex formed within the NHPPE of KRAS may be involved in the regulation of transcription. Indeed, transfection experiments showed that the activity of the mouse KRAS promoter is reduced to 20{\%} of control, in the presence of the quadruplex-stabilizing TMPyP4. In addition, we found that G-rich oligonucleotides mimicking the KRAS quadruplex, but not the corresponding 4-base mutant sequences or oligonucleotides forming quadruplexes with different structures, competed with the NHPPE duplex for binding to nuclear proteins. When vector pKRS-413, containing CAT driven by the mouse KRAS promoter, and KRAS quadruplex oligonucleotides were co-transfected in 293 cells, the expression of CAT was found to be downregulated to 40{\%} of the control. On the basis of these data, we propose that the NHPPE of KRAS exists in equilibrium between a double-stranded form favouring transcription and a folded quadruplex form, which instead inhibits transcription. Such a mechanism, which is probably adopted by other growth-related genes, provides useful hints for the rational design of anticancer drugs against the KRAS oncogene.},

Moreover, our approach reveals the relative importance of sequence-based features coming from both within the G4 motifs and their flanking regions.

abstract = {G-quadruplexes (G4) are tetrahelical structures formed from planar arrangement of guanines in nucleic acids. A simple, regular motif was originally proposed to describe G4-forming sequences. More recently, however, formation of G4 was discovered to depend, at least in part, on the contextual backdrop of neighboring sequences. Prediction of G4 folding is thus becoming more challenging as G4 outlier structures, not described by the originally proposed motif, are increasingly reported. Recent observations thus call for a comprehensive tool, capable of consolidating the expanding information on tested G4s, in order to conduct systematic comparative analyses of G4-promoting sequences. The G4RNA Database we propose was designed to help meet the need for easily-retrievable data on known RNA G4s. A user-friendly, flexible query system allows for data retrieval on experimentally tested sequences, from many separate genes, to assess G4-folding potential. Query output sorts data according to sequence position, G4 likelihood, experimental outcomes and associated bibliographical references. G4RNA also provides an ideal foundation to collect and store additional sequence and experimental data, considering the growing interest G4s currently generate.Database URL: scottgroup.med.usherbrooke.ca/G4RNA.},

@article{Roberts1992,
abstract = {Studies of a series of short oligonucleotide double and triple helices containing either all RNA, all DNA, or a mixture of the two show strand-dependent variation in their stability and structure. The variation in stability for both groups falls over a range of greater than 10 kilocalories per mole. In forming the triple helix, RNA is favored on both pyrimidine strands, whereas DNA is favored on the purine strand. In general, relatively unstable duplexes form particularly stable triplexes and vice versa. Structural data indicate thatthe strands in hybrid helices adopt a conformation that is intermediate between molecules containing all DNA and all RNA. Thus, RNA-DNA hybrids were not forced into the conformation of the RNA (A-form). The provocative stability of the triplex with an RNA third strand + DNA duplex points to novel antisense strategies and opens the possibility of an in vivo role of these structures. Overall, the data emphasize the fundamental role of sugars in determining the properties of nucleic acid complexes. Intermolecular triple helix formation has been implicated as a possible means of controlling cellular processes, either by an endogenous or exogenous mechanism. Tri-plexes have been shown to inhibit protein-DNA interaction and function in vitro (1), and there is evidence for similar inhibition in vivo (2). Functional triplexes could in principle be formed from some combination of RNA and DNA strands. However, relatively little is known about the role of strand composition, or even which complexes are stable. We report that there are dramatic differences in the stability and other properties of DNA, RNA, and hybrid duplexes and triplexes made from oligonu-cleotides. A simple view of the structure of RNA-DNA hybrid double and triple helices is that all strands are A form, with a C-3'endo sugar pucker. The rationale is that DNA can adopt either A-or B-form geometry (C-3'endo and C-2'endo sugar puckers, respectively), whereas RNA is overwhelmingly seen in the A form. Hybrids should thus adopt an A-form geometry to conform to the RNA strand. The single x-ray structure available for an RNA-DNA hybrid duplex supports this notion (3). The molecule contains both hybrid regions and all DNA duplex regions, all of which are A form. Similarly, fiber diffraction of homo and hybrid triplexes indicates that at high humidity they are all A form and have 11-or 12-fold helices with pitches ranging from 3.06 to 3.26 A (4). However, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (5) and fiber diffraction (6) of hybrid duplexes and NMR of DNA triplex-es (7) demonstrate the heteronomous nature of their structures (individual strands differ in their sugar pucker). In hybrid duplexes, the RNA strand appears C-3'endo (A-like), whereas the DNA strand does not (5). In DNA triple helices, the pyrimidine (Py) strands show a mixture of C-3'endo and C-2'endo sugar puckers, whereas the purine (Pu) strand is almost completely C-2'endo (B-like) (7). We show by comparative electrophoresis and circular dichroism (CD) measurements on homo and hybrid duplexes and triplexes that there is a gradient of structure between all-DNA and all-RNA helices. Triplex thermodynamics was measured either as the free energy (AG0) of binding the third strand to a duplex (triplex stability) or as the total AG' of forming triplex from the component single strands (total stability). These two measures turn out to be quite different. We find a general, if imperfect, anticorrelation between triplex stability and the stability of the underlying duplex. Relative instability appears to char-A' acterize duplexes with hightriplex stability, perhaps because the duplex structure is compatible with third-strand binding. Correspondingly , the energy required to distort the more stable duplex structures to form the triplex may be the source of their relative triplex instability. Total stability is markedly greater for triplexes in which the third strand is RNA. The observed variability in the complexes must lie in the chemical differences between RNA and DNA: the 2'OH and the thymine methyl groups, respectively. RNA should be favored where the preferred geometry is C-3'endo, and DNA should be favored when it is C-2'endo or when the hydrophobic effect plays a role (from burial of the thymine methyl). A methyl group on the 5 position of the pyrimidine ring has been shown to be stabilizing in the case of cytosine for the triple helix (8), probably because of the hydrophobic effect rather than alteration of the pKa of cytosine (9). We used oligonucleotide constructs consisting of a hairpin duplex with 5' Pu and 3' Py ends, and a Py third strand (10). The molecules synthesized (see Fig. 1) include four hairpin duplexes: (i) all DNA [DD]; (ii) all RNA [RRJ; (iii) DNA Pu strand + RNA Py strand [DRI; and (iv) RNA Pu strand + DNA Py strand IRD]. In addition, there are two all-Py third strands: (i) all DNA [D]; and (ii) all RNA [R] (11). All eight possible combinations of duplex with third strand were tested. Only six of the eight possible triplexes could be formed. Illustrative melting curves taken at pH 5.5 for these complexes are shown in Fig. 2. In the case for the two triplexes that do not form (D + RD, D + RR), only the transition corresponding to self-structure of the DNA Py strand (melt-ing temperature Tm = 22MC, half-height width of derivative melting curve = 11 .0C) is seen at low temperature. Van't Hoff analysis, with the all or none approximation , was used to determine the stan-B T-AT C+-GC Fig. 1. Schematic of sequences and base interactions.

In this study, we coupled Bru-seq technology with 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole 1-$\beta$-D-ribofuranoside (DRB) to estimate the elongation rates of over 2000 individual genes in human cells. This technique, BruDRB-seq, revealed gene-specific differences in elongation rates with a median rate of around 1.5 kb/min. We found that genes with rapid elongation rates showed higher densities of H3K79me2 and H4K20me1 histone marks compared to slower elongating genes. Furthermore, high elongation rates had a positive correlation with gene length, low complexity DNA sequence, and distance from the nearest active transcription unit. Features that negatively correlated with elongation rate included the density of exons, long terminal repeats, GC content of the gene, and DNA methylation density in the bodies of genes. Our results suggest that some static gene features influence transcription elongation rates and that cells may alter elongation rates by epigenetic regulation. The BruDRB-seq technique offers new opportunities to interrogate mechanisms of regulation of transcription elongation.},

This enables quantitative measurement of the GQ folding propensity and conformation specificity in both single strand (ss) and double strand (ds) DNA. Our GQ mapping indicates that the likelihood of GQ formation is substantially diminished in dsDNA, likely due to the competition from the Watson-Crick base pairing. Unlike GQ folding sequence in ssDNA which forms both parallel and antiparallel GQs, dsDNA displays only parallel folding. Additionally, we employed single molecule FRET to obtain a direct quantitation of stably formed-, weakly folded and unfolded GQ conformations.

abstract = {G-quadruplex or G4 DNA, a four-stranded DNA structure formed in G-rich sequences, has been hypothesized to be a structural motif involved in gene regulation. In this study, we examined the regulatory role of potential G4 DNA motifs (PG4Ms) located in the putative transcriptional regulatory region (TRR, -500 to +500) of genes across the human genome. We found that PG4Ms in the 500-bp region downstream of the annotated transcription start site (TSS; PG4M(D500)) are associated with gene expression. Generally, PG4M(D500)-positive genes are expressed at higher levels than PG4M(D500)-negative genes, and an increased number of PG4M(D500) provides a cumulative effect. This observation was validated by controlling for attributes, including gene family, function, and promoter similarity. We also observed an asymmetric pattern of PG4M(D500) distribution between strands, whereby the frequency of PG4M(D500) in the coding strand is generally higher than that in the template strand. Further analysis showed that the presence of PG4M(D500) and its strand asymmetry are associated with significant enrichment of RNAP II at the putative TRR. On the basis of these results, we propose a model of G4 DNA-mediated stimulation of transcription with the hypothesis that PG4M(D500) contributes to gene transcription by maintaining the DNA in an open conformation, while the asymmetric distribution of PG4M(D500) considerably reduces the probability of blocking the progression of the RNA polymerase complex on the template strand. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of the regulatory function of G4 DNA in gene transcription.},

abstract = {The emergence of a plant vascular system was a prerequisite for the colonization of land; however, it is unclear how the photosynthate transporting system was established during plant evolution. Here, we identify a novel translational regulatory module for phloem development involving the zinc-finger protein JULGI (JUL) and its targets, the 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of the SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1-LIKE4/5 (SMXL4/5) mRNAs, which is exclusively conserved in vascular plants. JUL directly binds and induces an RNA G-quadruplex in the 5′ UTR of SMXL4/5, which are key promoters of phloem differentiation. We show that RNA G-quadruplex formation suppresses SMXL4/5 translation and restricts phloem differentiation.

We propose that the translational regulation by the JUL/5′ UTR G-quadruplex module is a major determinant of phloem establishment, thereby determining carbon allocation to sink tissues, and that this mechanism was a key invention during the emergence of vascular plants.},

abstract = {G-quadruplexes are higher-order DNA and RNA structures formed from G-rich sequences that are built around tetrads of hydrogen-bonded guanine bases. Potential quadruplex sequences have been identified in G-rich eukaryotic telomeres, and more recently in non-telomeric genomic DNA, e.g. in nuclease-hypersensitive promoter regions. The natural role and biological validation of these structures is starting to be explored, and there is particular interest in them as targets for therapeutic intervention. This survey focuses on the folding and structural features on quadruplexes formed from telomeric and non-telomeric DNA sequences, and examines fundamental aspects of topology and the emerging relationships with sequence. Emphasis is placed on information from the high-resolution methods of X-ray crystallography and NMR, and their scope and current limitations are discussed. Such information, together with biological insights, will be important for the discovery of drugs targeting quadruplexes from particular genes.},

abstract = {The switch from vegetative to reproductive development in plants necessitates a switch in the developmental program of the descendents of the stem cells in the shoot apical meristem. Genetic and molecular investigations have demonstrated that the plant-specific transcription factor and meristem identity regulator LEAFY (LFY) controls this developmental transition by inducing expression of a second transcription factor, APETALA1, and by regulating the expression of additional, as yet unknown, genes. Here we show that the additional LFY targets include the APETALA1-related factor, CAULIFLOWER, as well as three transcription factors and two putative signal transduction pathway components. These genes are up-regulated by LFY even when protein synthesis is inhibited and, hence, appear to be direct targets of LFY. Supporting this conclusion, cis-regulatory regions upstream of these genes are bound by LFY in vivo. The newly identified LFY targets likely initiate the transcriptional changes that are required for the switch from vegetative to reproductive development in Arabidopsis.},

We have demonstrated that the purine-rich strand of the DNA in this region can form two different intramolecular G-quadruplex structures, only one of which seems to be biologically relevant. This biologically relevant structure is the kinetically favored chair-form G-quadruplex, which is destabilized when mutated with a single G --{\textgreater} A transition, resulting in a 3-fold increase in basal transcriptional activity of the c-MYC promoter. The cationic porphyrin TMPyP4, which has been shown to stabilize this G-quadruplex structure, is able to suppress further c-MYC transcriptional activation. These results provide compelling evidence that a specific G-quadruplex structure formed in the c-MYC promoter region functions as a transcriptional repressor element. Furthermore, we establish the principle that c-MYC transcription can be controlled by ligand-mediated G-quadruplex stabilization.},

abstract = {ATRX (alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked) belongs to the SWI2/SNF2 family of chromatin remodeling proteins. Besides the ATPase/helicase domain at its C terminus, it contains a PHD-like zinc finger at the N terminus. Mutations in the ATRX gene are associated with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) often accompanied by alpha thalassemia (ATRX syndrome). Although ATRX has been postulated to be a transcriptional regulator, its precise roles remain undefined. We demonstrate ATRX localization at the telomeres in interphase mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells in synchrony with the incorporation of H3.3 during telomere replication at S phase. Moreover, we found that chromobox homolog 5 (CBX5) (also known as heterochromatin protein 1 alpha, or HP1 alpha) is also present at the telomeres in ES cells. We show by coimmunoprecipitation that this localization is dependent on the association of ATRX with histone H3.3, and that mutating the K4 residue of H3.3 significantly diminishes ATRX and H3.3 interaction. RNAi-knockdown of ATRX induces a telomere-dysfunction phenotype and significantly reduces CBX5 enrichment at the telomeres. These findings suggest a novel function of ATRX, working in conjunction with H3.3 and CBX5, as a key regulator of ES-cell telomere chromatin.},

Grass genomes are particularly intriguing because they exhibit a strong bimodal distribution of genic GC content and a sharp 5'-3' decreasing GC content gradient along most genes. Here, we propose a unifying model to explain the main patterns of GC content variation at the gene and genome scale. We argue that GC content patterns could be mainly determined by the interactions between gene structure, recombination patterns, and GC-biased gene conversion. Recent studies on fine-scale recombination maps in angiosperms support this hypothesis and previous results also fit this model. We propose that our model could be used as a null hypothesis to search for additional forces that affect GC content in angiosperms.},

abstract = {Background: Many studies have shown that guanine-rich DNA sequences form quadruplex structures (G4) in vitro but there is scarce evidence of guanine quadruplexes in vivo. The majority of potential quadruplex-forming sequences (PQS) are located in transposable elements (TEs), especially close to promoters within long terminal repeats of plant LTR retrotransposons. Results: In order to test the potential effect of G4s on retrotransposon expression, we cloned the long terminal repeats of selected maize LTR retrotransposons upstream of the lacZ reporter gene and measured its transcription and translation in yeast. We found that G4s had an inhibitory effect on translation in vivo since " mutants " (where guanines were replaced by adenines in PQS) showed higher expression levels than wild-types. In parallel, we confirmed by circular dichroism measurements that the selected sequences can indeed adopt G4 conformation in vitro. Analysis of RNA-Seq of polyA RNA in maize seedlings grown in the presence of a G4-stabilizing ligand (NMM) showed both inhibitory as well as stimulatory effects on the transcription of LTR retrotransposons. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that quadruplex DNA located within long terminal repeats of LTR retrotransposons can be formed in vivo and that it plays a regulatory role in the LTR retrotransposon life-cycle, thus also affecting genome dynamics.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing increases transcriptome and proteome diversification. Previous analyses aiming at comparing the rate of alternative splicing between different organisms provided contradicting results. These contradicting results were attributed to the fact that both analyses were dependent on the expressed sequence tag (EST) coverage, which varies greatly between the tested organisms. In this study we compare the level of alternative splicing among eight different organisms. By employing an EST independent approach we reveal that the percentage of genes and exons undergoing alternative splicing is higher in vertebrates compared with invertebrates. We also find that alternative exons of the skipping type are flanked by longer introns compared to constitutive ones, whereas alternative 5' and 3' splice sites events are generally not. In addition, although the regulation of alternative splicing and sizes of introns and exons have changed during metazoan evolution, intron retention remained the rarest type of alternative splicing, whereas exon skipping is more prevalent and exhibits a slight increase, from invertebrates to vertebrates. The difference in the level of alternative splicing suggests that alternative splicing may contribute greatly to the mammal higher level of phenotypic complexity, and that accumulation of introns confers an evolutionary advantage as it allows increasing the number of alternative splicing forms.},

G2-type GQSes were most abundant in all the plant species analyzed. A strong association of G3-type GQSes with intergenic, promoter and intronic regions was found. However, G2-type GQSes were enriched in genic, CDS, exonic and untranslated regions. Further, we identified GQSes present in the conserved genes among monocots and dicots. The genes involved in development, cell growth and size, transmembrane transporter, and regulation of gene expression were found to be significantly enriched. In the promoter region, we detected strong co-occurrence of Telobox, ERF, MYB, RAV1B and E2F motifs with GQSes. Further, we validated the structure formation of several plant GQSes, demonstrated their effect on stalling in-vitro replication and revealed their interaction with plant nuclear proteins.

abstract = {To understand how potential for G-quadruplex formation might influence regulation of gene expression, we examined the 2 kb spanning the transcription start sites (TSS) of the 18 217 human RefSeq genes, distinguishing contributions of template and nontemplate strands. Regions both upstream and downstream of the TSS are G-rich, but the downstream region displays a clear bias toward G-richness on the nontemplate strand. Upstream of the TSS, much of the G-richness and potential for G-quadruplex formation derives from the presence of well-defined canonical regulatory motifs in duplex DNA, including CpG dinucleotides which are sites of regulatory methylation, and motifs recognized by the transcription factor SP1. This challenges the notion that quadruplex formation upstream of the TSS contributes to regulation of gene expression. Downstream of the TSS, G-richness is concentrated in the first intron, and on the nontemplate strand, where polymorphic sequence elements with potential to form G-quadruplex structures and which cannot be accounted for by known regulatory motifs are found in almost 3000 (16{\%}) of the human RefSeq genes, and are conserved through frogs. These elements could in principle be recognized either as DNA or as RNA, providing structural targets for regulation at the level of transcription or RNA processing.},

Binding of Met-tRNAi to the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, in a ternary complex (TC) with eIF2-GTP, is stimulated by eukaryotic initiation factor 1 (eIF1), eIF1A, eIF3, and eIF5, and the resulting preinitiation complex (PIC) joins the 5' end of mRNA preactivated by eIF4F and poly(A)-binding protein. RNA helicases remove secondary structures that impede ribosome attachment and subsequent scanning. Hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP is stimulated by eIF5 in the scanning PIC, but completion of the reaction is impeded at non-AUG triplets. Although eIF1 and eIF1A promote scanning, eIF1 and possibly the C-terminal tail of eIF1A must be displaced from the P decoding site to permit base-pairing between Met-tRNAi and the AUG codon, as well as to allow subsequent phosphate release from eIF2-GDP. A second GTPase, eIF5B, catalyzes the joining of the 60S subunit to produce an 80S initiation complex that is competent for elongation.},

abstract = {The third, or wobble, position in a codon provides a high degree of possible degeneracy and is an elegant fault-tolerance mechanism. Nucleotide biases between organisms at the wobble position have been documented and correlated with the abundances of the complementary tRNAs. We and others have noticed a bias for cytosine and guanine at the third position in a subset of transcripts within a single organism. The bias is present in some plant species and warm-blooded vertebrates but not in all plants, or in invertebrates or cold-blooded vertebrates. Here we demonstrate that in certain organisms the amount of GC at the wobble position (GC3) can be used to distinguish two classes of genes. We highlight the following features of genes with high GC3 content: they (1) provide more targets for methylation, (2) exhibit more variable expression, (3) more frequently possess upstream TATA boxes, (4) are predominant in certain classes of genes (e.g., stress responsive genes) and (5) have a GC3 content that increases from 5'to 3'. These observations led us to formulate a hypothesis to explain GC3 bimodality in grasses. Our findings suggest that high levels of GC3 typify a class of genes whose expression is regulated through DNA methylation or are a legacy of accelerated evolution through gene conversion. We discuss the three most probable explanations for GC3 bimodality: biased gene conversion, transcriptional and translational advantage and gene methylation.},

It has been suggested that Pol II stalling is used to produce dynamic and rapid responses of developmental patterning genes to transient cues such as extracellular signaling molecules. Here, we present a combined computational and experimental analysis of stalled promoters to determine how they come to bind Pol II in the early Drosophila embryo. At least one-fourth of the stalled promoters contain a shared sequence motif, the "pause button" (PB): KCGRWCG. The PB motif is sometimes located in the position of the DPE, and over one-fifth of the stalled promoters contain the following arrangement of core elements: GAGA, Inr, PB, and/or DPE. This arrangement was used to identify additional stalled promoters in the Drosophila genome, and permanganate footprint assays were used to confirm that the segmentation gene engrailed contains paused Pol II as seen for heat-shock genes. We discuss different models for Pol II binding and gene activation in the early embryo.},

abstract = {Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) are random oligonucleotide barcodes that are increasingly used in high-throughout sequencing experiments. Through a UMI, identical copies arising from distinct molecules can be distinguished from those arising through PCR amplification of the same molecule. However, bioinformatic methods to leverage the information from UMIs have yet to be formalised. In particular, sequencing errors in the UMI sequence are often ignored, or else resolved in an ad-hoc manner. We show that errors in the UMI sequence are common and introduce network based methods to account for these errors when identifying PCR duplicates. Using these methods, we demonstrate improved quantification accuracy both under simulated conditions and real iCLIP and single cell RNA-Seq datasets. Reproducibility between iCLIP replicates and single cell RNA Seq clustering are both improved using our proposed network-based method, demonstrating the value of properly accounting for errors in UMIs. These methods are implemented in the open source UMI-tools software package (https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools).},

Another modified sequence, d(UAGGGTBrUAGGGT), formed a predominantly antiparallel dimeric G-quadruplex with edgewise loops; the structure was asymmetric with six syn guanines and six anti guanines.

abstract = {Summary: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An over-dispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of over-dispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

Like PRC2, the Tip60-p400 histone acetyltransferase complex binds to nascent transcripts; however, transcription promotes chromatin binding of Tip60-p400 but not PRC2. Interestingly, we observed higher Tip60-p400 and lower PRC2 levels at genes marked by promoter-proximal R loops. Furthermore, disruption of R loops broadly decreased Tip60-p400 occupancy and increased PRC2 occupancy genome wide. In agreement with these alterations, ESCs partially depleted of R loops exhibited impaired differentiation. These results show that R loops act both positively and negatively in modulating the recruitment of key pluripotency regulators.},

The sequencing of many genomes has revealed that they are rich in sequence motifs that have the potential to form G-quadruplexes and that their location is non-random, correlating with functionally important genomic regions. In this short review, we summarize recent evidence for the in vivo presence and function of DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes in various cellular pathways including DNA replication, gene expression and telomere maintenance. We also highlight remaining open questions that will have to be addressed in the future.},

abstract = {RNA has a dual role as an informational molecule and a direct effector of biological tasks. The latter function is enabled by RNA's ability to adopt complex secondary and tertiary folds and thus has motivated extensive computational and experimental efforts for determining RNA structures. Existing approaches for evaluating RNA structure have been largely limited to in vitro systems, yet the thermodynamic forces which drive RNA folding in vitro may not be sufficient to predict stable RNA structures in vivo. Indeed, the presence of RNA-binding proteins and ATP-dependent helicases can influence which structures are present inside cells. Here we present an approach for globally monitoring RNA structure in native conditions in vivo with single-nucleotide precision. This method is based on in vivo modification with dimethyl sulphate (DMS), which reacts with unpaired adenine and cytosine residues, followed by deep sequencing to monitor modifications. Our data from yeast and mammalian cells are in excellent agreement with known messenger RNA structures and with the high-resolution crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ribosome. Comparison between in vivo and in vitro data reveals that in rapidly dividing cells there are vastly fewer structured mRNA regions in vivo than in vitro. Even thermostable RNA structures are often denatured in cells, highlighting the importance of cellular processes in regulating RNA structure. Indeed, analysis of mRNA structure under ATP-depleted conditions in yeast shows that energy-dependent processes strongly contribute to the predominantly unfolded state of mRNAs inside cells. Our studies broadly enable the functional analysis of physiological RNA structures and reveal that, in contrast to the Anfinsen view of protein folding whereby the structure formed is the most thermodynamically favourable, thermodynamics have an incomplete role in determining mRNA structure in vivo.},

I-motif structures are thought to form in cytosine-rich regions of the genome and to have regulatory functions; however, in vivo evidence for the existence of such structures has so far remained elusive. Here we report the generation and characterization of an antibody fragment (iMab) that recognizes i-motif structures with high selectivity and affinity, enabling the detection of i-motifs in the nuclei of human cells. We demonstrate that the in vivo formation of such structures is cell-cycle and pH dependent. Furthermore, we provide evidence that i-motif structures are formed in regulatory regions of the human genome, including promoters and telomeric regions. Our results support the notion that i-motif structures provide key regulatory roles in the genome.},

Therefore, elucidating RNA structure can provide profound insights into living systems. A recent marriage between in vivo RNA structure probing and next-generation sequencing (NGS) has revolutionized the RNA field by enabling transcriptome-wide structure determination in vivo, which has been applied to date to human cells, yeast cells, and Arabidopsis seedlings. Analysis of resultant in vivo 'RNA structuromes' provides new and important information regarding myriad cellular processes, including control of translation, alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation, energy-dependent unfolding of mRNA, and effects of proteins on RNA structure. An emerging view suggests potential links between RNA structure and stress and disease physiology across the tree of life. As we discuss here, these exciting findings open new frontiers into RNA biology, genome biology, and beyond.},

@article{Sundquist1989a,
abstract = {The telomeric ends of eukaryotic chromosomes are composed of simple repeating sequences in which one DNA strand contains short tracts of guanine residues alternating with short tracts of A/T-rich sequences. The guanine-rich strand is always oriented in a 5'-3' direction towards the end of the chromosome and is extended to produce a 3' overhang of about two repeating units in species where the telomeric terminus is known. This overhang has been implicated in the formation of several unusual intra-and intermolecular DNA structures, although none of these structures has been characterized fully. We now report that oligonucleotides encoding Tetrahymena telomeres dimerize to form stable complexes in solution. This salt-dependent dimerization is mediated entirely by the 3'-terminal telomeric overhang (TT-GGGGTTGGGG) and produces complexes in which the N7 position of every guanine in the overhangs is chemically inaccessible. We therefore propose that telomeric DNA dimerizes by hydrogen bonding between two intramolecular hairpin loops, to form antiparallel quadruplexes containing cyclic guanine base tetrads. These novel hairpin dimers may be important in telomere association and recombination and could also provide a general mechanism for pairing two double helices in other recombinational processes.},

We sequenced total RNA from human brain and liver and found a large fraction of reads (up to 40{\%}) within introns. Intronic RNAs were abundant in brain tissue, particularly for genes involved in axonal growth and synaptic transmission. Moreover, we detected significant differences in intronic RNA levels between fetal and adult brains. We show that the pattern of intronic sequence read coverage is explained by nascent transcription in combination with co-transcriptional splicing. Further analysis of co-transcriptional splicing indicates a correlation between slowly removed introns and alternative splicing. Our data show that sequencing of total RNA provides unique insight into the transcriptional processes in the cell, with particular importance for normal brain development.},

That said, their role within the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA remains to be elucidated and appreciated. A bioinformatic analysis of the 3'-UTRs of mRNAs revealed enrichment in G-quadruplexes. To shed light on the role(s) of these structures, those found in the LRP5 and FXR1 genes were characterized both in vitro and in cellulo. The 3'-UTR G-quadruplexes were found to increase the efficiencies of alternative polyadenylation sites, leading to the expression of shorter transcripts and to possess the ability to interfere with the miRNA regulatory network of a specific mRNA. Clearly, G-quadruplexes located in the 3'-UTRs of mRNAs are cis-regulatory elements that have a significant impact on gene expression.},

De novo transcriptome assembly can build a reference transcriptome from the non-model sequencing data, but falls short of allowing most tools to be applied. Here we present superTranscripts, a simple but powerful solution to bridge that gap. SuperTranscripts are a substitute for a reference genome, consisting of all the unique exonic sequence, in transcriptional order, such that each gene is represented by a single sequence. We demonstrate how superTranscripts allow visualization, variant detection and differential isoform detection in non-model organisms, using widely applied methods that are designed to work with reference genomes. SuperTranscripts can also be applied to model organisms to enhance visualization and discover novel expressed sequence. We describe Lace, software to construct superTranscripts from any set of transcripts including de novo assembled transcriptomes. In addition we used Lace to combine reference and assembled transcriptomes for chicken and recovered the sequence of hundreds of gaps in the reference genome.},

Here we show, by ChIP-Seq analysis of human cells, that 40{\%} of the binding sites of the transcription-associated helicases, XPB and XPD, overlap with G4 motifs. The highly significant overlap of XPB and XPD binding sites with G4 motifs cannot be explained by GC richness or parameters of the genomewide analysis, but instead suggests that these proteins are recruited to quadruplex structures that form in genomic DNA (G4 DNA). Biochemical analysis demonstrates that XPD is a robust G4 DNA helicase and that XPB binds G4 DNA. XPB and XPD are enriched near the transcription start site at 20{\%} of genes, especially highly transcribed genes. XPB and XPD enrichment at G4 motifs characterizes specific signaling pathways and regulatory pathways associated with specific cancers. These results identify new candidate pathways for therapies targeted to quadruplexes.},

RNAs are central to biological regulation, and the ability of RNA to adopt specific structures intimately controls every step of the gene expression program. However, our understanding of physiological RNA structures is limited; current in vivo RNA structure profiles include only two of the four nucleotides that make up RNA. Here we present a novel biochemical approach, in vivo click selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation and profiling experiment (icSHAPE), which enables the first global view, to our knowledge, of RNA secondary structures in living cells for all four bases. icSHAPE of the mouse embryonic stem cell transcriptome versus purified RNA folded in vitro shows that the structural dynamics of RNA in the cellular environment distinguish different classes of RNAs and regulatory elements. Structural signatures at translational start sites and ribosome pause sites are conserved from in vitro conditions, suggesting that these RNA elements are programmed by sequence. In contrast, focal structural rearrangements in vivo reveal precise interfaces of RNA with RNA-binding proteins or RNA-modification sites that are consistent with atomic-resolution structural data. Such dynamic structural footprints enable accurate prediction of RNA-protein interactions and N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) modification genome wide. These results open the door for structural genomics of RNA in living cells and reveal key physiological structures controlling gene expression.},

In the yeast S. cerevisiae, we report that G-quadruplexes form and, if not properly processed, pose a specific challenge to replication. We show that the G-quadruplex-prone CEB1 tandem array is tolerated when inserted near ARS305 replication origin in wild-type cells but is very frequently destabilized upon treatment with the potent Phen-DC(3) G-quadruplex ligand, or in the absence of the G-quadruplex-unwinding Pif1 helicase, only when the G-rich strand is the template of leading-strand replication. The orientation-dependent instability is associated with the formation of Rad51-Rad52-dependent X-shaped intermediates during replication detected by two-dimensional (2D) gels, and relies on the presence of intact G-quadruplex motifs in CEB1 and on the activity of ARS305. The asymmetrical behaviour of G-quadruplex prone sequences during replication has implications for their evolutionary dynamics within genomes, including the maintenance of G-rich telomeres.},

We demonstrate a previously unappreciated requirement for REV1 in replication of G4 forming sequences and show that transplanting a G4 forming sequence into a silent locus leads to its derepression in REV1-deficient cells. Together, our observations support a model in which failure to maintain processive DNA replication at G4 DNA in REV1-deficient cells leads to uncoupling of DNA synthesis from histone recycling, resulting in localized loss of repressive chromatin through biased incorporation of newly synthesized histones. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana is a dicot model organism for research in many aspects of plant biology. A comprehensive annotation of its genome paves the way for understanding the functions and activities of all types of transcripts, including mRNA, the various classes of non-coding RNA, and small RNA. The TAIR10 annotation update had a profound impact on Arabidopsis research but was released more than five years ago. Maintaining the accuracy of the annotation continues to be a prerequisite for future progress. Using an integrative annotation pipeline, we assembled tissue-specific RNA-Seq libraries from 113 datasets and constructed 48,359 transcript models of protein-coding genes in eleven tissues. In addition, we annotated various classes of non-coding RNA including microRNA, long intergenic RNA, small nucleolar RNA, natural antisense transcript, small nuclear RNA, and small RNA using published datasets and in-house analytic results. Altogether, we identified 635 novel protein-coding genes, 508 novel transcribed regions, 5,178 non-coding RNAs, and 35,846 small RNA loci that were formerly unannotated. Analysis of the splicing events and RNA-Seq based expression profiles revealed the landscapes of gene structures, untranslated regions, and splicing activities to be more intricate than previously appreciated. Furthermore, we present 692 uniformly expressed housekeeping genes, 43{\%} of whose human orthologs are also housekeeping genes. This updated Arabidopsis genome annotation with a substantially increased resolution of gene models will not only further our understanding of the biological processes of this plant model but also of other species.

Here, we identify a universally conserved profile of translation efficiency along mRNAs computed based on adaptation between coding sequences and the tRNA pool. In this profile, the first ∼30-50 codons are, on average, translated with a low efficiency. Additionally, in eukaryotes, the last ∼50 codons show the highest efficiency over the full coding sequence. The profile accurately predicts position-dependent ribosomal density along yeast genes. These data suggest that translation speed and, as a consequence, ribosomal density are encoded by coding sequences and the tRNA pool. We suggest that the slow " ramp" at the beginning of mRNAs serves as a late stage of translation initiation, forming an optimal and robust means to reduce ribosomal traffic jams, thus minimizing the cost of protein expression. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Genome instability via RNA:DNA hybrid-mediated R loops has been observed in mutants involved in various aspects of transcription and RNA processing. The prevalence of this mechanism among essential chromosome instability (CIN) genes remains unclear. In a secondary screen for increased Rad52 foci in CIN mutants, representing ∼25{\%} of essential genes, we identified seven essential subunits of the mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation (mCP) machinery. Genome-wide analysis of fragile sites by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and microarray (ChIP-chip) of phosphorylated H2A in these mutants supported a transcription-dependent mechanism of DNA damage characteristic of R loops. In parallel, we directly detected increased RNA:DNA hybrid formation in mCP mutants and demonstrated that CIN is suppressed by expression of the R-loop-degrading enzyme RNaseH. To investigate the conservation of CIN in mCP mutants, we focused on FIP1L1, the human ortholog of yeast FIP1, a conserved mCP component that is part of an oncogenic fusion in eosinophilic leukemia. We found that truncation fusions of yeast FIP1 analogous to those in cancer cause loss of function and that siRNA knockdown of FIP1L1 in human cells increases DNA damage and chromosome breakage. Our findings illuminate how mCP maintains genome integrity by suppressing R-loop formation and suggest that this function may be relevant to certain human cancers.},

abstract = {Spontaneous mutations in human somatic cells occur far more often than normal in individuals with Bloom syndrome. The basis for understanding these mutations and their developmental consequences emerges from examination of BS at the molecular, cellular, and clinical levels. The major clinical feature of BS, proportional dwarfism, as well as its major clinical complication, an exceptionally early emergence of neoplasia of the types and sites that affect the general population, are attributable to the excessive occurrence of mutations in somatic cells. Here, the following aspects of BS are discussed: (i) the BS phenotype; (ii) neoplasia in BS, including the means--the Bloom's Syndrome Registry--by which the significant risk for diverse sites and types of cancer in these patients was revealed; (iii) the biological basis for the cancer proneness of BS; and, finally, (iv) the significance for both basic human biology and clinical medicine of BS as the prototype of somatic mutational disease.},

abstract = {A major challenge in comparative genomics is to understand how phenotypic differences between species are encoded in their genomes. Phenotypic divergence may result from differential transcription of orthologous genes, yet less is known about the involvement of differential translation regulation in species phenotypic divergence. In order to assess translation effects on divergence, we analyzed approximately 2,800 orthologous genes in nine yeast genomes. For each gene in each species, we predicted translation efficiency, using a measure of the adaptation of its codons to the organism's tRNA pool. Mining this data set, we found hundreds of genes and gene modules with correlated patterns of translational efficiency across the species. One signal encompassed entire modules that are either needed for oxidative respiration or fermentation and are efficiently translated in aerobic or anaerobic species, respectively. In addition, the efficiency of translation of the mRNA splicing machinery strongly correlates with the number of introns in the various genomes. Altogether, we found extensive selection on synonymous codon usage that modulates translation according to gene function and organism phenotype. We conclude that, like factors such as transcription regulation, translation efficiency affects and is affected by the process of species divergence.},

Although chemically distinct, RNA can also fold in vitro into G-quadruplex structures that are highly stable because of the 2'-hydroxyl group. However, RNA G-quadruplexes have not yet been reported in cells. Here, we demonstrate the visualization of RNA G-quadruplex structures within the cytoplasm of human cells using a G-quadruplex structure-specific antibody. We also demonstrate that small molecules that bind to G-quadruplexes in vitro can trap endogenous RNA G-quadruplexes when applied to cells. Furthermore, a small molecule that exhibits a preference for RNA G-quadruplexes rather than DNA G-quadruplexes in biophysical experiments also shows the same selectivity within a cellular context. Our findings provide substantive evidence for RNA G-quadruplex formation in the human transcriptome, and corroborate the selectivity and application of stabilizing ligands that target G-quadruplexes within a cellular context.},

abstract = {We present a fast mapping-based algorithm to compute the mappability of each region of a reference genome up to a specified number of mismatches. Knowing the mappability of a genome is crucial for the interpretation of massively parallel sequencing experiments. We investigate the properties of the mappability of eukaryotic DNA/RNA both as a whole and at the level of the gene family, providing for various organisms tracks which allow the mappability information to be visually explored. In addition, we show that mappability varies greatly between species and gene classes. Finally, we suggest several practical applications where mappability can be used to refine the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data (SNP calling, gene expression quantification and paired-end experiments). This work highlights mappability as an important concept which deserves to be taken into full account, in particular when massively parallel sequencing technologies are employed.

abstract = {DNA:RNA hybrid formation is emerging as a significant cause of genome instability in biological systems ranging from bacteria to mammals. Here we describe the genome-wide distribution of DNA:RNA hybrid prone loci in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by DNA:RNA immunoprecipitation (DRIP) followed by hybridization on tiling microarray. These profiles show that DNA:RNA hybrids preferentially accumulated at rDNA, Ty1 and Ty2 transposons, telomeric repeat regions and a subset of open reading frames (ORFs). The latter are generally highly transcribed and have high GC content. Interestingly, significant DNA:RNA hybrid enrichment was also detected at genes associated with antisense transcripts. The expression of antisense-associated genes was also significantly altered upon overexpression of RNase H, which degrades the RNA in hybrids. Finally, we uncover mutant-specific differences in the DRIP profiles of a Sen1 helicase mutant, RNase H deletion mutant and Hpr1 THO complex mutant compared to wild type, suggesting different roles for these proteins in DNA:RNA hybrid biology. Our profiles of DNA:RNA hybrid prone loci provide a resource for understanding the properties of hybrid-forming regions in vivo, extend our knowledge of hybrid-mitigating enzymes, and contribute to models of antisense-mediated gene regulation.

abstract = {Transcriptional pausing by RNA polymerase is an underlying event in the regulation of transcript elongation, yet the physical changes in the transcribing complex that create the initially paused conformation remain poorly understood. We report that this nonbacktracked elemental pause results from an active-site rearrangement whose signature includes a trigger-loop conformation positioned near the RNA 3′ nucleotide and a conformation of $\beta$DloopII that allows fraying of the RNA 3′ nucleotide away from the DNA template. During nucleotide addition, trigger-loop movements or folding appears to assist NTP-stimulated translocation and to be crucial for catalysis. At a pause, the trigger loop directly contributes to the paused conformation, apparently by restriction of its movement or folding, whereas a previously postulated unfolding of the bridge helix does not. This trigger-loop-centric model can explain many properties of transcriptional pausing. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The electrodes incorporate a pH-selective barrel allowing each measurement to be assigned to either the cytosol or vacuole. The measure-ments revealed that vacuolar aK declined linearly with de-creases in tissue K+ concentration, whereas cytosolic aK initially remained constant in both epidermal and cortical cells but then declined at different rates in each cell type. An unexpected finding was that cytoplasmic pH declined in parallel with cytosolic aK, but acidification of the cytosol with butyrate did not reveal any short-term link between these two parameters. These measurements show the very different responses of the vacuolar and cytosolic K+ pools to changes in K+ availability and also show that cytosolic K+ homeostasis differs quantitatively in different cell types.

Here, we report the first NMR structure of a human telomeric G-quadruplex in crowded solution. We show that four different G-quadruplex conformations are converted to a propeller-type parallel-stranded G-quadruplex in K(+)-containing crowded solution due to water depletion. This study also reveals the formation of a new higher-order G-quadruplex structure under molecular crowding conditions. Our molecular dynamics simulations of solvent distribution provide insights at molecular level on the formation of parallel-stranded G-quadruplex in environment depleted of water.

STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90{\%} success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code.

A decline in telomerase activity was also observed in HL-60 cells treated with berberine. A stable clone of nucleophosmin/B23 over-expressed in HL-60 cells was selected and found to be less responsive to berberine-induced apoptosis. About 35{\%} to 63{\%} of control vector–transfected cells (pCR3) exhibited morphological characteristics of apoptosis, while about 8{\%} to 45{\%} of nucleophosmin/B23-over-expressed cells (pCR3-B23) became apoptotic after incubation with 15$\mu$g/ml berberine for 48 to 96 hr. DNA extracted from pCR3 cells contained more fragmented DNA than pCR3-B23 cells during treatment with 15$\mu$g/ml berberine for 24 to 48 hr. Our results indicate that berberine-induced apoptosis is associated with down-regulation of nucleophosmin/B23 and telomerase activity.

abstract = {Genomic experiments produce multiple views of biological systems, among them are DNA sequence and copy number variation, and mRNA and protein abundance. Understanding these systems needs integrated bioinformatic analysis. Public databases such as Ensembl provide relationships and mappings between the relevant sets of probe and target molecules. However, the relationships can be biologically complex and the content of the databases is dynamic. We demonstrate how to use the computational environment R to integrate and jointly analyze experimental datasets, employing BioMart web services to provide the molecule mappings. We also discuss typical problems that are encountered in making gene-to-transcript-to-protein mappings. The approach provides a flexible, programmable and reproducible basis for state-of-the-art bioinformatic data integration.},

abstract = {Methods used to sequence the transcriptome often produce more than 200 million short sequences. We introduce StringTie, a computational method that applies a network flow algorithm originally developed in optimization theory, together with optional de novo assembly, to assemble these complex data sets into transcripts. When used to analyze both simulated and real data sets, StringTie produces more complete and accurate reconstructions of genes and better estimates of expression levels, compared with other leading transcript assembly programs including Cufflinks, IsoLasso, Scripture and Traph. For example, on 90 million reads from human blood, StringTie correctly assembled 10,990 transcripts, whereas the next best assembly was of 7,187 transcripts by Cufflinks, which is a 53{\%} increase in transcripts assembled. On a simulated data set, StringTie correctly assembled 7,559 transcripts, which is 20{\%} more than the 6,310 assembled by Cufflinks. As well as producing a more complete transcriptome assembly, StringTie runs faster on all data sets tested to date compared with other assembly software, including Cufflinks.},

abstract = {myc is a proto-oncogene that plays an important role in the promotion of cellular growth and proliferation. Understanding the regulation of c-myc is important in cancer biology, as it is overexpressed in a wide variety of human cancers, including most gynecological, breast, and colon cancers. We previously demonstrated that a guanine-rich region upstream of the P1 promoter of c-myc that controls 85-90{\%} of the transcriptional activation of this gene can form an intramolecular G-quadruplex (G4) that functions as a transcriptional repressor element. In this study, we used an affinity column to purify proteins that selectively bind to the human c-myc G-quadruplex. We found that nucleolin, a multifunctional phosphoprotein, binds in vitro to the c-myc G-quadruplex structure with high affinity and selectivity when compared with other known quadruplex structures. In addition, we demonstrate that upon binding, nucleolin facilitates the formation and increases the stability of the c-myc G-quadruplex structure. Furthermore, we provide evidence that nucleolin overexpression reduces the activity of a c-myc promoter in plasmid presumably by inducing and stabilizing the formation of the c-myc G-quadruplex. Finally, we show that nucleolin binds to the c-myc promoter in HeLa cells, which indicates that this interaction occurs in vivo. In summary, nucleolin may induce c-myc G4 formation in vivo.},

abstract = {Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, which can assemble on pre-mRNA cotranscriptionally. However, whether splicing generally occurs during transcription has not been addressed. Indeed, splicing catalysis is expected to occur posttranscriptionally in yeast, where the shortness of terminal exons should leave insufficient time for splicing. Here, we isolate endogenous S. cerevisiae nascent RNA and determine gene-specific splicing efficiencies and transcription profiles, using high-density tiling microarrays. Surprisingly, we find that splicing occurs cotranscriptionally for the majority of intron-containing genes. Analysis of transcription profiles reveals Pol II pausing within the terminal exons of these genes. Intronless and inefficiently spliced genes lack this pause. In silico simulations of transcription and splicing kinetics confirm that this pausing event provides sufficient time for splicing before termination. The discovery of terminal exon pausing demonstrates functional coupling of transcription and splicing near gene ends. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Here, we address the hypothesis that G-quadruplex structures exist within double-stranded genomic DNA and can be explicitly identified using a G-quadruplex-specific probe. An engineered antibody is employed to enrich for DNA containing G-quadruplex structures, followed by deep sequencing to detect and map G-quadruplexes at high resolution in genomic DNA from human breast adenocarcinoma cells. Our high sensitivity structure-based pull-down strategy enables the isolation of genomic DNA fragments bearing single, as well as multiple G-quadruplex structures. Stable G-quadruplex structures are found in sub-telomeres, gene bodies and gene regulatory regions. For a sample of identified target genes, we show that G-quadruplex-stabilizing ligands can modulate transcription. These results confirm the existence of G-quadruplex structures and their persistence in human genomic DNA.},

Recent studies provide strong evidence for the formation and function of DNA and RNA GQSs in human cells. However, whether GQSs form and are functional in plants remains essentially unexplored. On the basis of circular dichroism (CD)-detected titration, UV-detected melting, in-line probing (ILP) and reporter gene assay studies, we report the first example of a plant RNA GQS that inhibits translation. This GQS is located within the 5'-UTR of the ATAXIA TELANGIECTASIA-MUTATED AND RAD3-RELATED (ATR) mRNA of Arabidopsis thaliana (mouse-ear cress). We show that this GQS is highly stable and is thermodynamically favoured over a competing hairpin structure in the 5'-UTR at physiological K⁺ and Mg²⁺ concentrations. Results from ILP reveal the secondary structure of the RNA and support formation of the GQS in vitro in the context of the complete 5'-UTR. Transient reporter gene assays performed in living plants reveal that the GQS inhibits translation but not transcription, implicating this GQS as a translational repressor in vivo. Our results provide the first complete demonstration of the formation and function of a regulatory RNA GQS in plants and open new avenues to explore potential functional roles of GQS in the plant kingdom.},

abstract = {Dynamic changes in histone modification are critical for regulating DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. Activation of the Tip60 acetyltransferase by DSBs requires interaction of Tip60 with histone H3 methylated on lysine 9 (H3K9me3). However, how H3K9 methylation is regulated during DSB repair is not known. Here, we demonstrate that a complex containing kap-1, HP1, and the H3K9 methyltransferase suv39h1 is rapidly loaded onto the chromatin at DSBs. Suv39h1 methylates H3K9, facilitating loading of additional kap-1/HP1/suv39h1 through binding of HP1's chromodomain to the nascent H3K9me3. This process initiates cycles of kap-1/HP1/suv39h1 loading and H3K9 methylation that facilitate spreading of H3K9me3 and kap-1/HP1/suv39h1 complexes for tens of kilobases away from the DSB. These domains of H3K9me3 function to activate the Tip60 acetyltransferase, allowing Tip60 to acetylate both ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase and histone H4. Consequently, cells lacking suv39h1 display defective activation of Tip60 and ATM, decreased DSB repair, and increased radiosensitivity. Importantly, activated ATM rapidly phosphorylates kap-1, leading to release of the repressive kap-1/HP1/suv39h1 complex from the chromatin. ATM activation therefore functions as a negative feedback loop to remove repressive suv39h1 complexes at DSBs, which may limit DSB repair. Recruitment of kap-1/HP1/suv39h1 to DSBs therefore provides a mechanism for transiently increasing the levels of H3K9me3 in open chromatin domains that lack H3K9me3 and thereby promoting efficient activation of Tip60 and ATM in these regions. Further, transient formation of repressive chromatin may be critical for stabilizing the damaged chromatin and for remodeling the chromatin to create an efficient template for the DNA repair machinery.},

As isoform level expression profiling receives more and more interest within genomics in recent years, exon microarray technology offers an important tool to quantify expression level of the majority of exons and enables the possibility of measuring isoform level expression. However, puma does not include methods for the analysis of exon array data. Moreover, the current expression summarisation method for Affymetrix 3' GeneChip data suffers from instability for low expression genes. For the downstream analysis, the method for differential expression detection is computationally intensive and the original expression clustering method does not consider the variance across the replicated technical and biological measurements. It is therefore necessary to develop improved uncertainty propagation methods for gene and transcript expression analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We extend the previously developed Bioconductor package puma with a new method especially designed for GeneChip Exon arrays and a set of improved downstream approaches. The improvements include: (i) a new gamma model for exon arrays which calculates isoform and gene expression measurements and a level of uncertainty associated with the estimates, using the multi-mappings between probes, isoforms and genes, (ii) a variant of the existing approach for the probe-level analysis of Affymetrix 3' GeneChip data to produce more stable gene expression estimates, (iii) an improved method for detecting differential expression which is computationally more efficient than the existing approach in the package and (iv) an improved method for robust model-based clustering of gene expression, which takes technical and biological replicate information into consideration.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: With the extensions and improvements, the puma package is now applicable to the analysis of both Affymetrix 3' GeneChips and Exon arrays for gene and isoform expression estimation. It propagates the uncertainty of expression measurements into more efficient and comprehensive downstream analysis at both gene and isoform level. Downstream methods are also applicable to other expression quantification platforms, such as RNA-Seq, when uncertainty information is available from expression measurements. puma is available through Bioconductor and can be found at http://www.bioconductor.org.},

abstract = {A significant part of eukaryotic genomes is formed by transposable elements (TEs) containing not only genes but also regulatory sequences. Some of the regulatory sequences located within TEs can form secondary structures like hairpins or three-stranded (triplex DNA) and four-stranded (quadruplex DNA) conformations. This review focuses on recent evidence showing that G-quadruplex-forming sequences in particular are often present in specific parts of TEs in plants and humans. We discuss the potential role of these structures in the TE life cycle as well as the impact of G-quadruplexes on replication, transcription, translation, chromatin status, and recombination. The aim of this review is to emphasize that TEs may serve as vehicles for the genomic spread of G-quadruplexes. These non-canonical DNA structures and their conformational switches may constitute another regulatory system that, together with small and long non-coding RNA molecules and proteins, contribute to the complex cellular network resulting in the large diversity of eukaryotes.},

@article{Sarkies2012,
abstract = {We have previously reported that DT40 cells deficient in the Y-family polymerase REV1 are defective in replicating G-quadruplex DNA. In vivo this leads to uncoupling of DNA synthesis from redeposition of histones displaced ahead of the replication fork, which in turn leads to loss of transcriptional repression due to failure to recycle pre-existing repressive histone post-translational modifications. Here we report that a similar process can also affect transcriptionally active genes, leading to their deactivation. We use this finding to develop an assay based on loss of expression of a cell surface marker to monitor epigenetic instability at the level of single cells. This assay allows us to demonstrate G4 DNA motif-associated epigenetic instability in mutants of three helicases previously implicated in the unwinding of G-quadruplex structures, FANCJ, WRN and BLM. Transcriptional profiling of DT40 mutants reveals that FANCJ coordinates two independent mechanisms to maintain epigenetic stability near G4 DNA motifs that are dependent on either REV1 or on the WRN and BLM helicases, suggesting a model in which efficient in vivo replication of G-quadruplexes often requires the established 5′–3′-helicase activity of FANCJ acting in concert with either a specialized polymerase or helicase operating in the opposite polarity.},

abstract = {N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMM) is exceptionally selective for G-quadruplexes (GQ) relative to duplex DNA and, as such, has found a wide range of applications in biology and chemistry. In addition, NMM is selective for parallel versus antiparallel GQ folds, as was recently demonstrated in our laboratory. Here, we present the X-ray crystal structure of a complex between NMM and human telomeric DNA dAGGG(TTAGGG)(3), Tel22, determined in two space groups, P2(1)2(1)2 and P6, at 1.65 and 2.15 {\AA} resolution, respectively. The former is the highest resolution structure of the human telomeric GQ DNA reported to date. The biological unit contains a Tel22 dimer of 5'-5' stacked parallel-stranded quadruplexes capped on both ends with NMM, supporting the spectroscopically determined 1:1 stoichiometry. NMM is capable of adjusting its macrocycle geometry to closely match that of the terminal G-tetrad required for efficient $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking. The out-of-plane N-methyl group of NMM fits perfectly into the center of the parallel GQ core where it aligns with potassium ions. In contrast, the interaction of the N-methyl group with duplex DNA or antiparallel GQ would lead to steric clashes that prevent NMM from binding to these structures, thus explaining its unique selectivity. On the basis of the biochemical data, binding of NMM to Tel22 does not rely on relatively nonspecific electrostatic interactions, which characterize most canonical GQ ligands, but rather it is hydrophobic in nature. The structural features observed in the NMM-Tel22 complex described here will serve as guidelines for developing new quadruplex ligands that have excellent affinity and precisely defined selectivity.},

abstract = {Central to the regulation and mechanism of class switch recombination is:the understanding of the relationship between transcription and DNA recombination. We demonstrated previously, using mini-chromosome substrates, that physiologically oriented transcription is required for recombination to occur between switch regions. In this report, we demonstrate the formation of an RNA:DNA complex under in vitro transcription conditions for these same and other switch DNA fragments. We find that cell-free transcription of repetitive murine switch regions (S$\mu$, S$\gamma$2b and S$\gamma$3) leads to altered DNA mobility on agarose gels. These altered mobilities are resistant to RNase A but sensitive to RNase H. Transcription in the presence of labeled ribonucleotides demonstrates the stable physical association of the RNA with the DNA. Importantly, complex formation only occurs upon transcription in the physiologic orientation. Reaban and Griffin found an RNA:DNA hybrid structure that was limited to an atypical 143 nucleotide purine region within a 2.3 kb S$\alpha$ segment. Here we demonstrate RNA:DNA hybrid formation in more typical switch sequences (lacking the atypical 143 nucleotide purine tract) from a variety of switch regions that are only 60-70{\%} purine on the non-template strand. These results suggest a general model involving an RNA:DNA complex as an intermediate during class switch recombination.},

In this study, we investigate the structural elements of nucleolin that are required for c-MYC repression. The effect of nucleolin deletion mutants on the formation and stability of the c-MYC G-quadruplex, as well as c-MYC transcriptional activity, was assessed by circular dichroism spectropolarimetry, thermal stability, and in vitro transcription. Here we report that nucleolin's RNA binding domains 3 and 4, as well as the arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) domain, are required to repress c-MYC transcription.},

abstract = {Summary Protein-coding genes in eukaryotes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and introns are removed from pre-mRNA by the spliceosome. Understanding the time lag between Pol II progression and splicing could provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of gene expression. Here, we present two single-molecule nascent RNA sequencing methods that directly determine the progress of splicing catalysis as a function of Pol II position. Endogenous genes were analyzed on a global scale in budding yeast. We show that splicing is 50{\%} complete when Pol II is only 45 nt downstream of introns, with the first spliced products observed as introns emerge from Pol II. Perturbations that slow the rate of spliceosome assembly or speed up the rate of transcription caused splicing delays, showing that regulation of both processes determines in vivo splicing profiles. We propose that matched rates streamline the gene expression pathway, while allowing regulation through kinetic competition.},

abstract = {Strand asymmetry in the distribution of guanines and cytosines, measured by GC skew, predisposes DNA sequences toward R-loop formation upon transcription. Previous work revealed that GC skew and R-loop formation associate with a core set of unmethylated CpG island (CGI) promoters in the human genome. Here, we show that GC skew can distinguish four classes of promoters, including three types of CGI promoters, each associated with unique epigenetic and gene ontology signatures. In particular, we identify a strong and a weak class of CGI promoters and show that these loci are enriched in distinct chromosomal territories reflecting the intrinsic strength of their protection against DNA methylation. Interestingly, we show that strong CGI promoters are depleted from the X chromosome while weak CGIs are enriched, a property consistent with the acquisition of DNA methylation during dosage compensation. Furthermore, we identify a third class of CGI promoters based on its unique GC skew profile and show that this gene set is enriched for Polycomb group targets. Lastly, we show that nearly 2000 genes harbor GC skew at their 3' ends and that these genes are preferentially located in gene-dense regions and tend to be closely arranged. Genomic profiling of R-loops accordingly showed that a large proportion of genes with terminal GC skew form R-loops at their 3' ends, consistent with a role for these structures in permitting efficient transcription termination. Altogether, we show that GC skew and R-loop formation offer significant insights into the epigenetic regulation, genomic organization, and function of human genes.},

The presence of additional motifs, as well as the nature of the glycine repeats, groups them in different classes. The diversity in structure as well as in expression pattern, modulation and sub-cellular localization have always indicated that these proteins, although classified as members of the same superfamily, would perform different functions in planta.

abstract = {In 1910, Bang1 reported that concentrated solutions of guanylic acid formed a gel. We have also observed that concentrated solutions (25.0 mg/ml) of guanylic acid (GMP) at pH 5 are extremely viscous and, if cooled, form a clear gel. Less con-centrated solutions also gel on cooling but assume a more normal viscosity at room temperature. From examination of the optical properties of the gel and in-vestigation of the structure of fibers obtained from the gel by drying, we have con-cluded that, at least in the case of the 5' isomer, the phenomenon may be explained as being due to helix formation by the guanylic acid. A possible structure is pre-sented for this helix. Materials and Methods.-Ultraviolet absorption was measured with a Cary Model 15 spectro-photometer, using an 0.1 mm cell. A water-jacketed cell housing was used to maintain tempera-ture. To measure optical densities greater than 2.0, calibrated neutral density screens were placed in the reference beam. In this way, optical densities up to at least 3.5 could be accurately meas-ured, the instrumental stray light level being sufficiently low. Optical rotation measurements were performed on a Rudolph Model 80 spectropolarimeter, using a water-jacketed 1-cm cell. Specific rotations are uncertain by 4 100. Fibers were obtained from concentrated solutions at pH 5 by suspending a drop of the material over the ends of a U-shaped piece of paper clip and allowing it to dry slowly at 40C. The material dried into highly negatively birefringent fibers 5 mm long by 0.1 to 0.3 mm wide.

abstract = {High-affinity binding sites for the hnRNP A1 protein stimulate the use of a distal 5' splice site in mammalian pre-mRNAs. Notably, strong A1-mediated shifts in splice site selection are not accompanied by equivalent changes in the assembly of U1 snRNP-containing complexes on competing 5' splice sites. To explain the above results, we have proposed that an interaction between hnRNP A1 molecules bound to high-affinity sites loops out the internal 5' splice site. Here, we present additional evidence in support of the looping out model. First, replacing A1 binding sites with sequences that can generate a loop through RNA duplex formation activates distal 5' splice site usage in an equivalent manner. Second, increasing the distance between the internal 5' splice site and flanking A1 binding sites does not compromise activation of the distal 5' splice site. Similar results were obtained with pre-mRNAs carrying inverted repeats. Using a pre-mRNA containing only one 5' splice site, we show that splicing is repressed when flanked by two high-affinity A1 binding sites or by inverted repeats, and that inactivation of the internal 5' splice site is sufficient to elicit a strong increase in the use of the distal donor site. Our results are consistent with the view that the binding of A1 to high-affinity sites promotes loop formation, an event that would repress the internal 5' splice site and lead to distal 5' splice site activation.},

abstract = {Background Secondary structures in 5′ UTR of mRNAs play a critical role in regulating protein synthesis. Though studies have indicated the role of secondary structure G-quadruplex in translational regulation, position-specific effect of G-quadruplex in naturally occurring mRNAs is still not understood. As a pre-initiation complex recognises 5′ cap of the mRNA and scans along the untranslated region (UTR) before initiating translation, the presence of G-quadruplex in 5′ region may have a significant contribution in regulating translation. Here, we investigate the role of G-quadruplex located at the 5′ end of an mRNA. Methods Biophysical characterisation of putative G-quadruplexes was performed using UV and CD spectroscopy. Functional implication of G-quadruplex in the context of their location was assessed in cellulo using qRT-PCR and dual luciferase assay system. Results PG4 sequences in 5′ UTR of AKT interacting protein (AKTIP), cathepsin B (CTSB) and forkhead box E3 (FOXE3) mRNAs form G-quadruplex whereas it is unable to form G-quadruplex in apolipoprotein A-I binding protein (APOA1BP). Our results demonstrated diverse roles of G-quadruplex located at 5′ end of mRNAs. Though G-quadruplex in AKTIP and CTSB mRNA act as inhibitory modules, it activates translation in FOXE3 mRNA. Conclusions Our works suggests that G-quadruplex present at the 5′ terminal of an mRNA behaves differently in a different gene context. It can activate or inhibit gene expression. General significance This study demonstrated that it is difficult to predict the role of G-quadruplex on the basis of its position in 5′ UTR. The neighbouring nucleotide sequence, the intracellular milieu and the interacting partners might render diverse functions to this secondary structure.},

abstract = {Analyzing vertebrate genomes requires rapid mRNA/DNA and cross-species protein alignments. A new tool, BLAT, is more accurate and 500 times faster than popular existing tools for mRNA/DNA alignments and 50 times faster for protein alignments at sensitivity settings typically used when comparing vertebrate sequences. BLAT's speed stems from an index of all nonoverlapping K-mers in the genome. This index fits inside the RAM of inexpensive computers, and need only be computed once for each genome assembly. BLAT has several major stages. It uses the index to find regions in the genome likely to be homologous to the query sequence. It performs an alignment between homologous regions. It stitches together these aligned regions (often exons) into larger alignments (typically genes). Finally, BLAT revisits small internal exons possibly missed at the first stage and adjusts large gap boundaries that have canonical splice sites where feasible. This paper describes how BLAT was optimized. Effects on speed and sensitivity are explored for various K-mer sizes, mismatch schemes, and number of required index matches. BLAT is compared with other alignment programs on various test sets and then used in several genome-wide applications. http://genome.ucsc.edu hosts a web-based BLAT server for the human genome.},

Moreover, after the release of Pol II from the promoter-proximal region, elongation rates are highly dynamic throughout the transcription of a gene, and vary on a gene-by-gene basis. Interestingly, Pol II elongation rates affect co-transcriptional processes such as splicing, termination and genome stability. Increasing numbers of factors and regulatory mechanisms have been associated with the steps of transcription elongation by Pol II, revealing that elongation is a highly complex process. Elongation is thus now recognized as a key phase in the regulation of transcription by Pol II.},

We haven then used the data (i) and the correlation (ii) to estimate the distribution of genes in isochore families. We have found that 34{\%} of the genes are located in the GC-poor isochores (which represent 62{\%} of the genome), 38{\%} in the GC-rich isochores (31{\%} of the genome) and 28{\%} in the GC-richest isochores (3 {\%} of the genome). There is, therefore, a compositional gradient of gene concentration in the human genome. The gene density in the GC-richest 3{\%} of the genome is about eight times higher than in the GC-rich 31{\%}, and about 16 times higher than in the GC-poorest 62{\%}.},

abstract = {TMPyP4 (Mesotetra(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphine) is known to have a high affinity for G-quadruplex DNA. However, there is still some controversy over the exact site(s) and mode(s) of TMPyP4 binding to G-quadruplex DNA. We examined TMPyP4 interactions with seven G-quadruplex forming oligonucleotides. The parent oligonucleotide is a 27-mer with a wild-type (WT) G-rich sequence of the Bcl-2 P1 promoter mid-region (5′-d(CGG GCG CGG GAG GAA GGG GGC GGG AGC-3′)). This sequence folds into at least three unique loop isomer quadruplexes. The two mutant oligonucleotides used in this study are shorter (23-mer) sequences in which nonquadruplex core bases were eliminated and two different (-G-G-) → (-T-T-) substitutions were made to restrict the folding complexity. The four additional mutant oligonucleotides were labeled by substituting a 2-aminopurine (2-AP) base for an A or G in either the first three-base lateral loop or the second five- or sevenbase lateral loop (depending on the G → T mutation positions). Spectroscopic and microcalorimetric studies indicate that four molecules of TMPyP4 can be bound to a single G-quadruplex. Binding of the first two moles of TMPyP4 appears to occur by an end or exterior mode (K ≈ 1 × 107M-1), whereas binding of the third and fourth moles of TMPyP4 appears to occur by a weaker, intercalative binding mode (K ≈ 1 × 105M-1). As the mid-loop size decreases from seven to five bases, end binding occurs with significantly increased affinity. 2-AP-labeled Bcl-2 promoter region quadruplexes show increased fluorescence of the 2-AP base on addition of TMPyP4. The change in fluorescence for 2-AP bases in the second half of the TMPyP4 titration lends support to our previous speculation regarding the intercalative nature of the weaker binding mode. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

We present a solid-state NMR approach for studying ions associated with G-quartets based on the direct NMR observation of 23Na+ ion resonances and report new methods for studying quadrupolar nuclei in biological solids. In the tetraplex forming oligonucleotide d(TG4T), high-field (17.6 T) NMR spectra cleanly resolve three distinct classes of sodium ions. A high-resolution 2D-MQMAS spectrum established the assignment of an amorphously broadened signal at -19 ppm (relative to 0.1 M NaCl) to surface-bound Na+ ions. Two-dimensional nutation spectroscopy was used to indicate the relative size of the quadrupole coupling for each line, while a standard exchange experiment established a correlation between surface (-19 ppm) and channel-bound (6.8 ppm) Na+ ions. Finally, free sodium ions are observed at 0 ppm.

abstract = {A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of read counts from RNA-Seq gene expression studies. It provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation. Biological variation between RNA samples is estimated separately from the technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline is implemented in the edgeR package of the Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq applications, including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks and DNA methylation analyses.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing accounts for much of the complexity in higher eukaryotes. Thus, its regulation must allow for flexibility without hampering either its specificity or its fidelity. The mechanisms involved in alternative splicing regulation, especially those acting through coupling with transcription, have not been deeply studied in in vivo models. Much of our knowledge comes from in vitro approaches, where conditions can be precisely controlled at the expense of losing several levels of regulation present in intact cells. Here we studied the relative order of removal of the introns flanking a model alternative cassette exon. We show that there is a preferential removal of the intron downstream from the cassette exon before the upstream intron has been removed. Most importantly, both cis-acting mutations and trans-acting factors that regulate the model alternative splicing event differentially affect the relative order of removal. However, reduction of transcriptional elongation causing higher inclusion of the cassette exon does not change the order of intron removal, suggesting that the assumption, according to the "first come, first served" model, that slow elongation promotes preferential excision of the upstream intron has to be revised. We propose instead that slow elongation favors commitment to exon inclusion during spliceosome assembly. Our results reveal that measuring the order of intron removal may be a straightforward read-out to discriminate among different mechanisms of alternative splice site selection.},

Here we characterize the plant NatA complex and reveal evolutionary conservation of NatA biochemical properties in higher eukaryotes and uncover specific and essential functions of NatA for development, biosynthetic pathways and stress responses in plants. We show that NTA decreases significantly after drought stress, and NatA abundance is rapidly downregulated by the phytohormone abscisic acid. Accordingly, transgenic downregulation of NatA induces the drought stress response and results in strikingly drought resistant plants. Thus, we propose that NTA by the NatA complex acts as a cellular surveillance mechanism during stress and that imprinting of the proteome by NatA is an important switch for the control of metabolism, development and cellular stress responses downstream of abscisic acid.},

abstract = {Spliceosome assembly and/or splicing of a nascent transcript may be crucial for proper isoform expression and gene regulation in higher eukaryotes. We recently showed that cotranscriptional splicing occurs efficiently in Drosophila, but there are not comparable genome-wide nascent splicing data from mammals. To provide this comparison, we analyze a recently generated, high-throughput sequencing data set of mouse liver nascent RNA, originally studied for circadian transcriptional regulation. Cotranscriptional splicing is approximately twofold less efficient in mouse liver than in Drosophila, i.e., nascent intron levels relative to exon levels are ∼0.55 in mouse versus 0.25 in the fly. An additional difference between species is that only mouse cotranscriptional splicing is optimal when 5'-exon length is between 50 and 500 bp, and intron length does not correlate with splicing efficiency, consistent with exon definition. A similar analysis of intron and exon length dependence in the fly is more consistent with intron definition. Contrasted with these differences are many similarities between the two systems: Alternatively annotated introns are less efficiently spliced cotranscriptionally than constitutive introns, and introns of single-intron genes are less efficiently spliced than introns from multi-intron genes. The most striking common feature is intron position: Cotranscriptional splicing is much more efficient when introns are far from the 3' ends of their genes. Additionally, absolute gene length correlates positively with cotranscriptional splicing efficiency independently of intron location and position, in flies as well as in mice. The gene length and distance effects indicate that more "nascent time" gives rise to greater cotranscriptional splicing efficiency in both systems.},

abstract = {Messenger RNA (mRNA) 3' end formation is a nuclear process through which all eukaryotic primary transcripts are endonucleolytically cleaved and most of them acquire a poly(A) tail. This process, which consists in the recognition of defined poly(A) signals of the pre-mRNAs by a large cleavage/polyadenylation machinery, plays a critical role in gene expression. Indeed, the poly(A) tail of a mature mRNA is essential for its functions, including stability, translocation to the cytoplasm and translation. In addition, this process serves as a bridge in the network connecting the different transcription, capping, splicing and export machineries. It also participates in the quantitative and qualitative regulation of gene expression in a variety of biological processes through the selection of single or alternative poly(A) signals in transcription units. A large number of protein factors associates with this machinery to regulate the efficiency and specificity of this process and to mediate its interaction with other nuclear events. Here, we review the eukaryotic 3' end processing machineries as well as the comprehensive set of regulatory factors and discuss the different molecular mechanisms of 3' end processing regulation by proposing several overlapping models of regulation.},

abstract = {The Y-family DNA polymerase Rev1 is required for successful replication of G-quadruplex DNA (G4 DNA) in higher eukaryotes. Here we show that human Rev1 (hRev1) disrupts G4 DNA structures and prevents refolding in vitro. Nucleotidyl transfer by hRev1 is not necessary for mechanical unfolding to occur. hRev1 binds G4 DNA substrates with Kd,DNA values that are 4-15-fold lower than those of non-G4 DNA substrates. The pre-steady-state rate constant of deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP) insertion opposite the first tetrad-guanine by hRev1 is ∼56{\%} as fast as that observed for non-G4 DNA substrates. Thus, hRev1 can promote fork progression by either dislodging tetrad guanines to unfold the G4 DNA, which could assist in extension by other DNA polymerases, or hRev1 can prevent refolding of G4 DNA structures. The hRev1 mechanism of action against G-quadruplexes helps explain why replication progress is impeded at G4 DNA sites in Rev1-deficient cells and illustrates another unique feature of this enzyme with important implications for genome maintenance.},

Quantification of chromatin- and nucleoplasm-associated P-SF3b155 after fractionation of HeLa cell nuclei, reveals that {\~{}}80{\%} of pre-mRNA splicing occurs co-transcriptionally. Active spliceosomes localize in situ to regions of decompacted chromatin, at the periphery of or within nuclear speckles. Immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-P-SF3b155 antibodies, coupled with transcription inhibition and a block in splicing after SF3b155 phosphorylation, indicates that post-transcriptional splicing occurs in nuclear speckles and that release of post-transcriptionally spliced mRNA from speckles is coupled to the nuclear mRNA export pathway. Our data provide new insights into when and where splicing occurs in cells.},

We previously identified the major tetramolecular quadruplex DNA resolving activity in HeLa cell lysates as the gene product of DHX36 (Vaughn, J. P., Creacy, S. D., Routh, E. D., Joyner-Butt, C., Jenkins, G. S., Pauli, S., Nagamine, Y., and Akman, S. A. (2005) J. Biol Chem. 280, 38117-38120), naming the enzyme G4 Resolvase 1 (G4R1). G4R1 is also known as RHAU, an RNA helicase associated with the AU-rich sequence of mRNAs. We now show that G4R1/RHAU binds to and resolves tetramolecular RNA quadruplex as well as tetramolecular DNA quadruplex structures. The apparent K(d) values of G4R1/RHAU for tetramolecular RNA quadruplex and tetramolecular DNA quadruplex were exceptionally low: 39 +/- 6 and 77 +/- 6 Pm, respectively, as measured by gel mobility shift assay. In competition studies tetramolecular RNA quadruplex structures inhibited tetramolecular DNA quadruplex structure resolution by G4R1/RHAU more efficiently than tetramolecular DNA quadruplex structures inhibited tetramolecular RNA quadruplex structure resolution. Down-regulation of G4R1/RHAU in HeLa T-REx cells by doxycycline-inducible short hairpin RNA caused an 8-fold loss of RNA and DNA tetramolecular quadruplex resolution, consistent with G4R1/RHAU representing the major tetramolecular quadruplex helicase activity for both RNA and DNA structures in HeLa cells. This study demonstrates for the first time the RNA quadruplex resolving enzymatic activity associated with G4R1/RHAU and its exceptional binding affinity, suggesting a potential novel role for G4R1/RHAU in targeting in vivo RNA quadruplex structures.},

For example, eIF4A promotes T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia development in vivo and is required for leukaemia maintenance. Accordingly, inhibition of eIF4A with silvestrol has powerful therapeutic effects against murine and human leukaemic cells in vitro and in vivo. We use transcriptome-scale ribosome footprinting to identify the hallmarks of eIF4A-dependent transcripts. These include 5' untranslated region (UTR) sequences such as the 12-nucleotide guanine quartet (CGG)4 motif that can form RNA G-quadruplex structures. Notably, among the most eIF4A-dependent and silvestrol-sensitive transcripts are a number of oncogenes, superenhancer-associated transcription factors, and epigenetic regulators. Hence, the 5' UTRs of select cancer genes harbour a targetable requirement for the eIF4A RNA helicase.},

After detection of a DSB, the DNA damage and repair response is initiated and the DSB is repaired by non-homologous end joining and/or homologous recombination. Many components of these processes are still unknown in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this work, we characterized $\gamma$-irradiation and mitomycin C induced 1 (GMI1), a member of the SMC-hinge domain-containing protein family. RT-PCR analysis and promoter-GUS fusion studies showed that $\gamma$-irradiation, the radio-mimetic drug bleocin, and the DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin C strongly enhance GMI1 expression particularly in meristematic tissues. The induction of GMI1 by $\gamma$-irradiation depends on the signalling kinase Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) but not on ATM and Rad3-related (ATR). Epistasis analysis of single and double mutants demonstrated that ATM acts upstream of GMI1 while the atr gmi1-2 double mutant was more sensitive than the respective single mutants. Comet assay revealed a reduced rate of DNA double-strand break repair in gmi1 mutants during the early recovery phase after exposure to bleocin. Moreover, the rate of homologous recombination of a reporter construct was strongly reduced in gmi1 mutant plants upon exposure to bleocin or mitomycin C. GMI1 is the first member of its protein family known to be involved in DNA repair.},

abstract = {Genome-wide replication timing studies have suggested that mammalian chromosomes consist of megabase-scale domains of coordinated origin firing separated by large originless transition regions. Here, we report a quantitative genome-wide analysis of DNA replication kinetics in several human cell types that contradicts this view. DNA combing in HeLa cells sorted into four temporal compartments of S phase shows that replication origins are spaced at 40 kb intervals and fire as small clusters whose synchrony increases during S phase and that replication fork velocity (mean 0.7 kb/min, maximum 2.0 kb/min) remains constant and narrowly distributed through S phase. However, multi-scale analysis of a genome-wide replication timing profile shows a broad distribution of replication timing gradients with practically no regions larger than 100 kb replicating at less than 2 kb/min. Therefore, HeLa cells lack large regions of unidirectional fork progression. Temporal transition regions are replicated by sequential activation of origins at a rate that increases during S phase and replication timing gradients are set by the delay and the spacing between successive origin firings rather than by the velocity of single forks. Activation of internal origins in a specific temporal transition region is directly demonstrated by DNA combing of the IGH locus in HeLa cells. Analysis of published origin maps in HeLa cells and published replication timing and DNA combing data in several other cell types corroborate these findings, with the interesting exception of embryonic stem cells where regions of unidirectional fork progression seem more abundant. These results can be explained if origins fire independently of each other but under the control of long-range chromatin structure, or if replication forks progressing from early origins stimulate initiation in nearby unreplicated DNA.

abstract = {The accurate propagation of histone marks during chromosomal replication is proposed to rely on the tight coupling of replication with the recycling of parental histones to the daughter strands. Here, we show in the avian cell line DT40 that REV1, a key regulator of DNA translesion synthesis at the replication fork, is required for the maintenance of repressive chromatin marks and gene silencing in the vicinity of DNA capable of forming G-quadruplex (G4) structures. We demonstrate a previously unappreciated requirement for REV1 in replication of G4 forming sequences and show that transplanting a G4 forming sequence into a silent locus leads to its derepression in REV1-deficient cells. Together, our observations support a model in which failure to maintain processive DNA replication at G4 DNA in REV1-deficient cells leads to uncoupling of DNA synthesis from histone recycling, resulting in localized loss of repressive chromatin through biased incorporation of newly synthesized histones. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Because inactivating mutations of these genes are common in human pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs), we examined the telomere status of these tumors. We found that 61{\%} of PanNETs displayed abnormal telomeres that are characteristic of a telomerase-independent telomere maintenance mechanism termed ALT (alternative lengthening of telomeres). All of the PanNETs exhibiting these abnormal telomeres had ATRX or DAXX mutations or loss of nuclear ATRX or DAXX protein. ATRX mutations also correlate with abnormal telomeres in tumors of the central nervous system. These data suggest that an alternative telomere maintenance function may operate in human tumors with alterations in the ATRX or DAXX genes.},

However, the qualitative and quantitative mechanisms controlling cell wall enlargement are still poorly understood. Here, we report the molecular and functional characterization of LRX1, a new Arabidopsis gene that encodes a chimeric leucine-rich repeat/extensin protein. LRX1 is expressed in root hair cells and the protein is specifically localized in the wall of the hair proper, where it becomes insolubilized during development. lrx1-null mutants, isolated by a reverse-genetic approach, develop root hairs that frequently abort, swell, or branch. Complementation and overexpression experiments using modified LRX1 proteins indicate that the interaction with the cell wall is important for LRX1 function. These results suggest that LRX1 is an extracellular component of a mechanism regulating root hair morphogenesis and elongation by controlling either polarized growth or cell wall formation and assembly.},

abstract = {Background: Many studies have shown that guanine-rich DNA sequences form quadruplex structures (G4) in vitro but there is scarce evidence of guanine quadruplexes in vivo. The majority of potential quadruplex-forming sequences (PQS) are located in transposable elements (TEs), especially close to promoters within long terminal repeats of plant LTR retrotransposons. Results: In order to test the potential effect of G4s on retrotransposon expression, we cloned the long terminal repeats of selected maize LTR retrotransposons upstream of the lacZ reporter gene and measured its transcription and translation in yeast. We found that G4s had an inhibitory effect on translation in vivo since " mutants " (where guanines were replaced by adenines in PQS) showed higher expression levels than wild-types. In parallel, we confirmed by circular dichroism measurements that the selected sequences can indeed adopt G4 conformation in vitro. Analysis of RNA-Seq of polyA RNA in maize seedlings grown in the presence of a G4-stabilizing ligand (NMM) showed both inhibitory as well as stimulatory effects on the transcription of LTR retrotransposons. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that quadruplex DNA located within long terminal repeats of LTR retrotransposons can be formed in vivo and that it plays a regulatory role in the LTR retrotransposon life-cycle, thus also affecting genome dynamics.},

abstract = {Transposable elements (TEs) are ubiquitous genome inhabitants in eukaryotes. Increasing evidence shows that TEs are involved in regulatory networks of eukaryotic cells and contribute to genome evolution. Recently, we reported that many plant long-terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons contain DNA quadruplex-forming sequences at precise positions inside their LTRs and that quadruplexes are better preserved in evolutionary younger elements. As quadruplexes can modulate molecular processes, quadruplexes found at specific distances upstream and downstream from the endogenous TE promoter can affect transcription of the element. Moreover, quadruplexes found in solo LTRs, as well as in 3' ends of 5'-truncated copies of LINE-1 elements, can affect expression of neighboring genes. Here, we propose that this way retrotransposons can serve as vehicles for spread of DNA quadruplexes. Quadruplexes can thus fulfill a dual regulatory role-to influence both the retrotransposons carrying them and the neighboring host genes, e.g., by direct effect on transcription or by modifying the local chromatin state. Additionally, four-stranded DNA structures may serve as hotspots for recombination-based genome rearrangements.},

We generated an extensive catalog of nascent and steady-state transcripts in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings using global nuclear run-on sequencing (GRO-seq), 5'GRO-seq, and RNA-seq and reanalyzed published maize data to capture characteristics of plant transcription. De novo annotation of nascent transcripts accurately mapped start sites and unstable transcripts. Examining the promoters of coding and noncoding transcripts identified comparable chromatin signatures, a conserved "TGT" core promoter motif and unreported transcription factor-binding sites. Mapping of engaged RNA polymerases showed a lack of enhancer RNAs, promoter-proximal pausing, and divergent transcription in Arabidopsis seedlings and maize, which are commonly present in yeast and humans. In contrast, Arabidopsis and maize genes accumulate RNA polymerases in proximity of the polyadenylation site, a trend that coincided with longer genes and CpG hypomethylation. Lack of promoter-proximal pausing and a higher correlation of nascent and steady-state transcripts indicate Arabidopsis may regulate transcription predominantly at the level of initiation. Our findings provide insight into plant transcription and eukaryotic gene expression as a whole.},

abstract = {We have previously reported that DT40 cells deficient in the Y-family polymerase REV1 are defective in replicating G-quadruplex DNA. In vivo this leads to uncoupling of DNA synthesis from redeposition of histones displaced ahead of the replication fork, which in turn leads to loss of transcriptional repression due to failure to recycle pre-existing repressive histone post-translational modifications. Here we report that a similar process can also affect transcriptionally active genes, leading to their deactivation. We use this finding to develop an assay based on loss of expression of a cell surface marker to monitor epigenetic instability at the level of single cells. This assay allows us to demonstrate G4 DNA motif-associated epigenetic instability in mutants of three helicases previously implicated in the unwinding of G-quadruplex structures, FANCJ, WRN and BLM. Transcriptional profiling of DT40 mutants reveals that FANCJ coordinates two independent mechanisms to maintain epigenetic stability near G4 DNA motifs that are dependent on either REV1 or on the WRN and BLM helicases, suggesting a model in which efficient in vivo replication of G-quadruplexes often requires the established 5′–3′-helicase activity of FANCJ acting in concert with either a specialized polymerase or helicase operating in the opposite polarity.},

abstract = {Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are oppositely imprinted autism-spectrum disorders with known genetic bases, but complex epigenetic mechanisms underlie their pathogenesis. The PWS/AS locus on 15q11-q13 is regulated by an imprinting control region that is maternally methylated and silenced. The PWS imprinting control region is the promoter for a one megabase paternal transcript encoding the ubiquitous protein-coding Snrpn gene and multiple neuron-specific noncoding RNAs, including the PWS-related Snord116 repetitive locus of small nucleolar RNAs and host genes, and the antisense transcript to AS-causing ubiquitin ligase encoding Ube3a (Ube3a-ATS). Neuron-specific transcriptional progression through Ube3a-ATS correlates with paternal Ube3a silencing and chromatin decondensation. Interestingly, topoisomerase inhibitors, including topotecan, were recently identified in an unbiased drug screen for compounds that could reverse the silent paternal allele of Ube3a in neurons, but the mechanism of topotecan action on the PWS/AS locus is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that topotecan treatment stabilizes the formation of RNA:DNA hybrids (R loops) at G-skewed repeat elements within paternal Snord116, corresponding to increased chromatin decondensation and inhibition of Ube3a-ATS expression. Neural precursor cells from paternal Snord116 deletion mice exhibit increased Ube3a-ATS levels in differentiated neurons and show a reduced effect of topotecan compared with wild-type neurons. These results demonstrate that the AS candidate drug topotecan acts predominantly through stabilizing R loops and chromatin decondensation at the paternally expressed PWS Snord116 locus. Our study holds promise for targeted therapies to the Snord116 locus for both AS and PWS.},

Here, we identified thousands of mammalian RNA regions that can fold into G-quadruplexes in vitro, but in contrast to previous assumptions, these regions were overwhelmingly unfolded in cells. Model RNA G-quadruplexes that were unfolded in eukaryotic cells were folded when ectopically expressed in Escherichia coli; however, they impaired translation and growth, which helps explain why we detected few G-quadruplex-forming regions in bacterial transcriptomes. Our results suggest that eukaryotes have a robust machinery that globally unfolds RNA G-quadruplexes, whereas some bacteria have instead undergone evolutionary depletion of G-quadruplex-forming sequences.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic heterochromatin is characterized by a high density of repeats and transposons, as well as by modified histones, and influences both gene expression and chromosome segregation. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomy-ces pombe, we deleted the argonaute, dicer, and RNA-dependent RNA poly-merase gene homologs, which encode part of the machinery responsible for RNA interference (RNAi). Deletion results in the aberrant accumulation of complementary transcripts from centromeric heterochromatic repeats. This is accompanied by transcriptional de-repression of transgenes integrated at the centromere, loss of histone H3 lysine-9 methylation, and impairment of cen-tromere function. We propose that double-stranded RNA arising from centro-meric repeats targets formation and maintenance of heterochromatin through RNAi.},

abstract = {R-loop, a three-stranded RNA/DNA structure, has been linked to induced genome instability and regulated gene expression. To enable precision analysis of R-loops in vivo, we develop an RNase-H-based approach; this reveals predominant R-loop formation near gene promoters with strong G/C skew and propensity to form G-quadruplex in non-template DNA, corroborating with all biochemically established properties of R-loops. Transcription perturbation experiments further indicate that R-loop induction correlates to transcriptional pausing. Interestingly, we note that most mapped R-loops are each linked to a nearby free RNA end; by using a ribozyme to co-transcriptionally cleave nascent RNA, we demonstrate that such a free RNA end coupled with a G/C-skewed sequence is necessary and sufficient to induce R-loop. These findings provide a topological solution for RNA invasion into duplex DNA and suggest an order for R-loop initiation and elongation in an opposite direction to that previously proposed. Chen et al. developed R-ChIP to map R-loops genome-wide with high resolution. Most captured R-loops are associated with gene promoters and dynamically correlated with transcriptional pausing. They further demonstrated that a free RNA end coupled with a preferred G/C skew sequence is required to promote R-loop formation.},

abstract = {Retrotransposons with long terminal repeats (LTR) form a significant proportion of eukaryotic genomes, especially in plants. They have gag and pol genes and several regulatory regions necessary for transcription and reverse transcription. We searched for potential quadruplex-forming sequences (PQSs) and potential triplex-forming sequences (PTSs) in 18 377 full-length LTR retrotransposons collected from 21 plant species. We found that PQSs were often located in LTRs, both upstream and downstream of promoters from which the whole retrotransposon is transcribed. Upstream-located guanine PQSs were dominant in the minus DNA strand, whereas downstream-located guanine PQSs prevailed in the plus strand, indicating their role both at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Our circular dichroism spectroscopy measurements confirmed that these PQSs readily adopted guanine quadruplex structures-some of them were paralell-stranded, while others were anti-parallel-stranded. The PQS often formed doublets at a mutual distance of up to 400 bp. PTSs were most abundant in 3'UTR (but were also present in 5'UTR). We discuss the potential role of quadruplexes and triplexes as the regulators of various processes participating in LTR retrotransposon life cycle and as potential recombination sites during post-insertional retrotransposon-based genome rearrangements.},

abstract = {Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies enable rapid and cheap genome-wide transcriptome analysis, providing vital information about gene structure, transcript expression and alternative splicing. Key to this is the the accurate identification of exon-exon junctions from RNA sequenced (RNA-seq) reads. A number of RNA-seq aligners capable of splitting reads across these splice junctions (SJs) have been developed, however, it has been shown that while they correctly identify most genuine SJs available in a given sample, they also often produce large numbers of incorrect SJs. Herein we describe the extent of this problem using popular RNA-seq mapping tools, and present a new method, called Portcullis, to rapidly filter false SJs junctions from spliced alignments produced by any RNA-seq mapper capable of creating SAM/BAM files. We show that Portcullis distinguishes between genuine and false positive junctions to a high-degree of accuracy across different species, samples, expression levels, error profiles and read lengths. Portcullis makes efficient use of memory and threading and, to our knowledge, is currently the only SJ prediction tool that reliably scales for use with large RNAseq datasets and large highly fragmented genomes, whilst delivering highly accurate SJs.},

abstract = {G quadruplexes (G4s) can present potent blocks to DNA replication. Accurate and timely replication of G4s in vertebrates requires multiple specialized DNA helicases and polymerases to prevent genetic and epigenetic instability. Here we report that PrimPol, a recently described primase-polymerase (PrimPol), plays a crucial role in the bypass of leading strand G4 structures. While PrimPol is unable to directly replicate G4s, it can bind and reprime downstream of these structures. Disruption of either the catalytic activity or zinc-finger of PrimPol results in extreme G4-dependent epigenetic instability at the BU-1 locus in avian DT40 cells, indicative of extensive uncoupling of the replicative helicase and polymerase. Together, these observations implicate PrimPol in promoting restart of DNA synthesis downstream of, but closely coupled to, G4 replication impediments. Schiavone, Jozwiakowski et al. demonstrate that the recently described primase-polymerase in vertebrates, PrimPol, plays an important role in replicating G quadruplex (G4) structures by binding them and repriming DNA-leading strand synthesis close by. This maintains processive replication and prevents disruption of histone recycling, ensuring epigenetic stability around G4s.},

abstract = {G-quadruplex structures in RNA molecules are known to have regulatory impacts in cells but are difficult to locate in the genome. The minimal requirements for G-quadruplex folding in RNA (G(a parts per thousand{\textless}yen{\textgreater}3)N(1-7) G(a parts per thousand{\textless}yen{\textgreater}3)N(1-7) G(a parts per thousand{\textless}yen{\textgreater}3)N(1-7) G(a parts per thousand{\textless}yen{\textgreater}3)) is being challenged by observations made on specific examples in recent years. The definition of potential G-quadruplex sequences has major repercussions on the observation of the structure since it introduces a bias. The canonical motif only describes a sub-population of the reported G-quadruplexes. To address these issues, we propose an RNA G-quadruplex prediction strategy that does not rely on a motif definition. We trained an artificial neural network with sequences of experimentally validated G-quadruplexes from the G4RNA database encoded using an abstract definition of their sequence. This artificial neural network, G4NN, evaluates the similarity of a given sequence to known G-quadruplexes and reports it as a score. G4NN has a predictive power comparable to the reported G richness and G/C skewness evaluations that are the current state-of-the-art for the identification of potential RNA G-quadruplexes. We combined these approaches in the G4RNA screener, a program designed to manage and evaluate the sequences to identify potential G-quadruplexes.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) is used extensively to characterize the transcriptome of cells. Many transcriptomic studies aim at comparing either abundance levels or the transcriptome composition between given conditions, and as a first step, the sequencing reads must be used as the basis for abundance quantification of transcriptomic features of interest, such as genes or transcripts. Several different quantification approaches have been proposed, ranging from simple counting of reads that overlap given genomic regions to more complex estimation of underlying transcript abundances. In this paper, we show that gene-level abundance estimates and statistical inference offer advantages over transcript-level analyses, in terms of performance and interpretability. We also illustrate that while the presence of differential isoform usage can lead to inflated false discovery rates in differential expression analyses on simple count matrices and transcript-level abundance estimates improve the performance in simulated data, the difference is relatively minor in several real data sets. Finally, we provide an R package ( tximport ) to help users integrate transcript-level abundance estimates from common quantification pipelines into count-based statistical inference engines.},
