abstract = {The chromosomes of lower eukaryotes have short telomeric 3′ extensions. Using a primer-extension/nick-translation technique and nondenaturing hybridization, we find long 3′ G-rich tails at human chromosome ends in mortal primary fibroblasts, umbilical vein endothelial cells, and leukocytes, as well as in immortalized fibroblasts. For all cells tested, {\textgreater}80{\%} of the telomeres have long G-rich overhangs, averaging 130–210 bases in length, in disagreement with the conventional model for incomplete lagging-strand replication, which predicts overhangs on 50{\%} of the chromosome ends. The observed G tails must exist during most of the cell cycle and probably result from degradation of both chromosome ends. The average lengths of the G tails are quantitatively consistent with the observed rates of human chromosome shortening.},

abstract = {Mutations in XPB, an essential subunit of the transcription/repair factor TFIIH, lead to nucleotide excision repair (NER) defects and xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). The role of XPB in NER and the molecular mechanisms resulting in XP are poorly understood. Here, we show that the p52 subunit of TFIIH interacts with XPB and stimulates its ATPase activity. A mutation found among XP-B patients (F99S) weakens this interaction and the resulting ATPase stimulation, thereby explaining the defect in the damaged DNA opening. We next found that mutations in the helicase motifs III (T469A) and VI (Q638A) that inhibit XPB helicase activity preserve the NER function of TFIIH. Our results suggest a mechanism in which the helicase activity of XPB is not used for the opening and repair of damaged DNA, which is instead only driven by its ATPase activity, in combination with the helicase activity of XPD.},

Both structures are dimeric G-quadruplexes involving three stacked G-tetrads. The sequence d(TAGGGUTAGGGT), containing a single thymine-to-uracil substitution at position 6, formed a predominantly parallel dimeric G-quadruplex with double-chain-reversal loops; the structure was symmetric, and all guanines were anti. Another modified sequence, d(UAGGGTBrUAGGGT), formed a predominantly antiparallel dimeric G-quadruplex with edgewise loops; the structure was asymmetric with six syn guanines and six anti guanines. The two structures can coexist and interconvert in solution. For the latter sequence, the antiparallel form is more favorable at low temperatures ({\textless}50 °C), while the parallel form is more favorable at higher temperatures; at temperatures lower than 40 °C, the antiparallel G-quadruplex folds faster but unfolds slower than the par...},

abstract = {RNA G-quadruplexes located within the 5′-UTR of mRNA are almost always known to be associated with repression of cap-dependent translation. However, in this report we present functional as well as structural evidence that sequence redundancy in a G-rich segment within the 5′-UTR of human VEGF mRNA supports a ‘switchable' RNA G-quadruplex structure that is essential for IRES-mediated translation initiation. Additionally, utilization of a specific combination of G-tracts within this segment allows for the conformational switch that implies a tunable regulatory role of the quadruplex structure in translation initiation. A sequence engineered from a functionally handicapped mutant moderately rescued the activity, further indicating the importance of G-quadruplex structure for VEGF IRES-A function. This to our knowledge is the first report of a conformationally flexible RNA G-quadruplex which is essential for IRES-mediated translation initiation.},

abstract = {G-quadruplex (G4) can be formed by G-rich DNA sequences that are widely distributed throughout the human genome. Although G-triplex and G-hairpin have been proposed as G4 folding intermediates, their formation still requires further investigation by experiments. Here, we employed single-molecule FRET to characterize the folding dynamics of G4 from human telomeric sequence. First, we observed four states during G4 folding initially assigned to be anti-parallel G4, G-triplex, G-hairpin and unfolded ssDNA. Then we constructed putative intra-strand G-triplex, G-hairpin structures and confirmed their existences in both NaCl and KCl. Further studies revealed those structures are going through dynamic transitions between different states and show relatively weak dependence on cations, unlike G4. Based on those results and molecular dynamics simulations, we proposed a multi-pathway folding mechanism for human telomeric G4. The present work may shed new light on our current understanding about the existence and stability of G4 intermediate states.},

abstract = {G-quadruplex or G4 DNA, a four-stranded DNA structure formed in G-rich sequences, has been hypothesized to be a structural motif involved in gene regulation. In this study, we examined the regulatory role of potential G4 DNA motifs (PG4Ms) located in the putative transcriptional regulatory region (TRR, -500 to +500) of genes across the human genome. We found that PG4Ms in the 500-bp region downstream of the annotated transcription start site (TSS; PG4M(D500)) are associated with gene expression. Generally, PG4M(D500)-positive genes are expressed at higher levels than PG4M(D500)-negative genes, and an increased number of PG4M(D500) provides a cumulative effect. This observation was validated by controlling for attributes, including gene family, function, and promoter similarity. We also observed an asymmetric pattern of PG4M(D500) distribution between strands, whereby the frequency of PG4M(D500) in the coding strand is generally higher than that in the template strand. Further analysis showed that the presence of PG4M(D500) and its strand asymmetry are associated with significant enrichment of RNAP II at the putative TRR. On the basis of these results, we propose a model of G4 DNA-mediated stimulation of transcription with the hypothesis that PG4M(D500) contributes to gene transcription by maintaining the DNA in an open conformation, while the asymmetric distribution of PG4M(D500) considerably reduces the probability of blocking the progression of the RNA polymerase complex on the template strand. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of the regulatory function of G4 DNA in gene transcription.},

abstract = {Changes in RNA conformation can alter gene expression. The guanine quadruplex sequence (GQS) is an RNA motif that folds in the presence of K+ ions. Changes in the conformation of this motif could be especially important in regulating gene expression in plants because intracellular K+ concentrations often increase during drought stress. Little is known about the folding thermodynamics of RNA GQS. We show here that RNA GQS with tracts containing three G's [e.g., (GGGxx)4] have a modest dependence on the K+ concentration, folding with no or even negative cooperativity (Hill coefficients ≤1), and are associated with populated folding intermediates. In contrast, GQS with tracts containing just two G's [e.g., (GGxx)4] have a steep dependence on the K+ concentration and fold with positive cooperativity (Hill coefficients of 1.7–2.7) without significantly populating intermediate states. We postulate that in plants, the more stable G3 sequences are largely folded even under unstressed conditions, while the less st...},

abstract = {ATRX is an X-linked gene of the SWI/SNF family, mutations in which cause syndromal mental retardation and downregulation of $\alpha$-globin expression. Here we show that ATRX binds to tandem repeat (TR) sequences in both telomeres and euchromatin. Genes associated with these TRs can be dysregulated when ATRX is mutated, and the change in expression is determined by the size of the TR, producing skewed allelic expression. This reveals the characteristics of the affected genes, explains the variable phenotypes seen with identical ATRX mutations, and illustrates a new mechanism underlying variable penetrance. Many of the TRs are G rich and predicted to form non-B DNA structures (including G-quadruplex) in vivo. We show that ATRX binds G-quadruplex structures in vitro, suggesting a mechanism by which ATRX may play a role in various nuclear processes and how this is perturbed when ATRX is mutated.

abstract = {The first plant glycine–rich proteins (GRPs) have been isolated more than 20 years ago based on their specific expression pattern and/or modulation by several biotic and abiotic factors. This superfamily is characterized by the presence of a glycine-rich domain arranged in (Gly)n-X repeats. The presence of additional motifs, as well as the nature of the glycine repeats, groups them in different classes. The diversity in structure as well as in expression pattern, modulation and sub-cellular localization have always indicated that these proteins, although classified as members of the same superfamily, would perform different functions in planta. Only now, two decades later, with the first functional characterizations of plant GRPs their involvement in diverse biological and biochemical processes are being uncovered. Here, we review the so far ascribed functions of plant GRPs.},

abstract = {We present the solution structure of d(CCCTA 2 CCCTA 2 CCCTA 2 CCCT), a fragment of the vertebrate telomere which folds intramolecularly. The four cytidine stretches form an i-motif which includes six intercalated C{\'{A}}C  pairs and terminates with the cytidines at the 5 H extremity of each stretch. Above, the second TA 2 linker loops across one of the narrow grooves, while at the bottom, the {\textregistered}rst and third linkers loop across the wide grooves. At 30 C, the spectra of the {\textregistered}rst and third linkers are quasi-degenerate. Severe broadening at lower temperature indicates that this results from motional averaging between at least two structures of each bottom loop, and makes it impossible to solve the con{\textregistered}guration of the bottom loops directly, in contrast to the rest of the structure. We therefore turned to the modi{\textregistered}ed sequence d(CCCTA 2 5mCCC-TA 2 CCCUA 2 CCCT) in which the two base substitutions (underlined) break the quasi-symmetry between linkers 1 and 3. The three loops follow approximately the hairpin``hairpin``second pattern'' of Hilbers. In the {\textregistered}rst loop, T4 is in the syn orientation, whereas its analog in the third loop, U16, oriented anti, is in a central location, where it interacts with bases of both loops, thus contributing to their tight association. The only motion is a syn/anti ¯ip of A18 in the third loop. Returning to the telomere fragment, we show that each of the bottom loops switches between the structures identi{\textregistered}ed in the {\textregistered}rst and third loops of the modi{\textregistered}ed structure. The motions are concerted, and the resulting con{\textregistered}gurations of the bottom loop cluster present a bulge to either right (T4 syn) or left (T16 syn).},

abstract = {RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) is bound to the promoter regions of many or most developmental control genes before their activation during Drosophila embryogenesis. It has been suggested that Pol II stalling is used to produce dynamic and rapid responses of developmental patterning genes to transient cues such as extracellular signaling molecules. Here, we present a combined computational and experimental analysis of stalled promoters to determine how they come to bind Pol II in the early Drosophila embryo. At least one-fourth of the stalled promoters contain a shared sequence motif, the “pause button” (PB): KCGRWCG. The PB motif is sometimes located in the position of the DPE, and over one-fifth of the stalled promoters contain the following arrangement of core elements: GAGA, Inr, PB, and/or DPE. This arrangement was used to identify additional stalled promoters in the Drosophila genome, and permanganate footprint assays were used to confirm that the segmentation gene engrailed contains paused Pol II as seen for heat-shock genes. We discuss different models for Pol II binding and gene activation in the early embryo.},

Here, we have shown that the correlations (iii, a and b) for ‘localized genes' and genes from the bank are in full agreement, indicating that the former set is representative of the latter. We haven then used the data (i) and the correlation (ii) to estimate the distribution of genes in isochore families. We have found that 34{\%} of the genes are located in the GC-poor isochores (which represent 62{\%} of the genome), 38{\%} in the GC-rich isochores (31{\%} of the genome) and 28{\%} in the GC-richest isochores (3 {\%} of the genome). There is, therefore, a compositional gradient of gene concentration in the human genome. The gene density in the GC-richest 3{\%} of the genome is about eight times higher than in the GC-rich 31{\%}, and about 16 times higher than in the GC-poorest 62{\%}.},

The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C.  Python is also suitable as an extension language for highly customizable C applications such as editors or window managers. Python is available for various operating systems, amongst which several flavors of UNIX, Amoeba, the Apple Macintosh O.S., and MS-DOS. This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system.  It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but as the examples are self-contained, the tutorial can be read off-line as well.

abstract = {Transcriptional regulation of gene expression is a major mechanism used by plants to confer phenotypic plasticity, and yet compared with other eukaryotes or bacteria, little is known about the design principles. We generated an extensive catalog of nascent and steady-state transcripts in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings using global nuclear run-on sequencing (GRO-seq), 5'GRO-seq, and RNA-seq and reanalyzed published maize data to capture characteristics of plant transcription. De novo annotation of nascent transcripts accurately mapped start sites and unstable transcripts. Examining the promoters of coding and noncoding transcripts identified comparable chromatin signatures, a conserved "TGT" core promoter motif and unreported transcription factor-binding sites. Mapping of engaged RNA polymerases showed a lack of enhancer RNAs, promoter-proximal pausing, and divergent transcription in Arabidopsis seedlings and maize, which are commonly present in yeast and humans. In contrast, Arabidopsis and maize genes accumulate RNA polymerases in proximity of the polyadenylation site, a trend that coincided with longer genes and CpG hypomethylation. Lack of promoter-proximal pausing and a higher correlation of nascent and steady-state transcripts indicate Arabidopsis may regulate transcription predominantly at the level of initiation. Our findings provide insight into plant transcription and eukaryotic gene expression as a whole.},

The unifying theme in this review is energetics. The thermodynamic stability of quadruplexes has not been studied in the same detail as DNA and RNA duplexes, and there are important differences in the balance of forces between these classes of folded oligonucleotides. We provide an overview of the principles of stability and where available the experimental data that report on these principles. Significant gaps in the literature have been identified, that should be filled by a systematic study of well-defined quadruplexes not only to provide the basic understanding of stability both for design purposes, but also as it relates to in vivo occurrence of quadruplexes. Techniques that are commonly applied to the determination of the structure, stability and folding are discussed in terms of information content and limitations. Quadruplex structures fold and unfold comparatively slowly, and DNA unwinding events associated with transcription and replication may be operating far from equilibrium. The kinetics of formation and resolution of quadruplexes, and methodologies are discussed in the context of stability and their possible biological occurrence.},

abstract = {To safeguard genetic integrity, cells have evolved an accurate but not failsafe mechanism of DNA replication. Not all DNA sequences tolerate DNA replication equally well [1]. Also, genomic regions that impose structural barriers to the DNA replication fork are a potential source of genetic instability [2, 3]. Here, we demonstrate that G4 DNA—a sequence motif that folds into quadruplex structures in vitro [4, 5]—is highly mutagenic in vivo and is removed from genomes that lack dog-1, the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian FANCJ [6, 7], which is mutated in Fanconi anemia patients [8–11]. We show that sequences that match the G4 DNA signature G3-5N1-3G3-5N1-3G3-5N1-3G3-5 are deleted in germ and somatic tissues of dog-1 animals. Unbiased aCGH analyses of dog-1 genomes that were allowed to accumulate mutations in {\textgreater}100 replication cycles indicate that deletions are found exclusively at G4 DNA; deletion frequencies can reach 4{\%} per site per animal generation. We found that deletion sizes fall short of Okazaki fragment lengths [12], and no significant microhomology was observed at deletion junctions. The existence of 376,000 potentially mutagenic G4 DNA sites in the human genome could have major implications for the etiology of hereditary FancJ and nonhereditary cancers.},

abstract = {The telomeric ends of eukaryotic chromosomes are composed of simple repeating sequences in which one DNA strand contains short tracts of guanine residues alternating with short tracts of A/T-rich sequences. The guanine-rich strand is always oriented in a 5'-3' direction towards the end of the chromosome and is extended to produce a 3' overhang of about two repeating units in species where the telomeric terminus is known. This overhang has been implicated in the formation of several unusual intra-and intermolecular DNA structures, although none of these structures has been characterized fully. We now report that oligonucleotides encoding Tetrahymena telomeres dimerize to form stable complexes in solution. This salt-dependent dimerization is mediated entirely by the 3'-terminal telomeric overhang (TT-GGGGTTGGGG) and produces complexes in which the N7 position of every guanine in the overhangs is chemically inaccessible. We therefore propose that telomeric DNA dimerizes by hydrogen bonding between two intramolecular hairpin loops, to form antiparallel quadruplexes containing cyclic guanine base tetrads. These novel hairpin dimers may be important in telomere association and recombination and could also provide a general mechanism for pairing two double helices in other recombinational processes.},

This motif confers the ability to form an unusual four-stranded DNA structure, G4 DNA. G4 DNA is associated with genomic instability, which may explain depletion of G4 motifs from some genes and genomic regions. Conversely, G4 motifs are enriched downstream of transcription start sites, where they correlate with pausing. The uneven distribution of G4 motifs in the genome strongly suggests that mechanisms of selection act not only on one-dimensional genomic sequence, but also on structures formed by genomic DNA. The biological roles of G4 structures illustrate that, to understand genome function, it is important to consider the dynamic structural potential implicit in the G4 motif.},

abstract = {Motivation G-quadruplexes (G4s) are one of the non-B DNA structures easily observed in vitro and assumed to form in vivo. The latest experiments with G4-specific antibodies and G4-unwinding helicase mutants confirm this conjecture. These four-stranded structures have also been shown to influence a range of molecular processes in cells. As G4s are intensively studied, it is often desirable to screen DNA sequences and pinpoint the precise locations where they might form. Results We describe and have tested a newly developed Bioconductor package for identifying potential quadruplex-forming sequences (PQS). The package is easy-to-use, flexible and customizable. It allows for sequence searches that accommodate possible divergences from the optimal G4 base composition. A novel aspect of our research was the creation and training (parametrization) of an advanced scoring model which resulted in increased precision compared to similar tools. We demonstrate that the algorithm behind the searches has a 96{\%} accuracy on 392 currently known and experimentally observed G4 structures. We also carried out searches against the recent G4-seq data to verify how well we can identify the structures detected by that technology. The correlation with pqsfinder predictions was 0.622, higher than the correlation 0.491 obtained with the second best G4Hunter.

abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) diversifies transcriptomes and proteomes and is widely recognized as a key mechanism for regulating gene expression. Previously, in an analysis of intron retention events in Arabidopsis, we found unusual AS events inside annotated protein-coding exons. Here, we also identify such AS events in human and use these two sets to analyse their features, regulation, functional impact, and evolutionary origin. As these events involve introns with features of both introns and protein-coding exons, we name them exitrons (exonic introns). Though exitrons were detected as a subset of retained introns, they are clearly distinguishable, and their splicing results in transcripts with different fates. About half of the 1002 Arabidopsis and 923 human exitrons have sizes of multiples of 3 nucleotides (nt). Splicing of these exitrons results in internally deleted proteins and affects protein domains, disordered regions, and various post-translational modification sites, thus broadly impacting protein function. Exitron splicing is regulated across tissues, in response to stress and in carcinogenesis. Intriguingly, annotated intronless genes can be also alternatively spliced via exitron usage. We demonstrate that at least some exitrons originate from ancestral coding exons. Based on our findings, we propose a "splicing memory" hypothesis whereby upon intron loss imprints of former exon borders defined by vestigial splicing regulatory elements could drive the evolution of exitron splicing. Altogether, our studies show that exitron splicing is a conserved strategy for increasing proteome plasticity in plants and animals, complementing the repertoire of AS events.},

It has previously been shown that a target's availability to miRNA can be affected by its structure. G-quadruplexes (G4) are noncanonical structures adopted by G-rich nucleic acids that have been shown to have multiple biological functions. In this study, whether or not G4 structures' presence in the 3' UTRs of mRNAs can hinder miRNA binding was investigated. Putative G4 overlapping with predicted miRNAs' binding sites was searched for, and 44,294 hits were found in humans. The FADS2 mRNA/mir331-3p pair was selected as a model example. In-line probing and G4-specific fluorescent ligand experiments binding were performed and confirmed the presence of a G4 near the predicted miRNA binding site. Subsequent luciferase assays showed that the presence of the G4 prevents the binding of mir331-3p in cellulo. Together, these results served as proof of concept that a G4 structure present in a 3' UTR sequence should be taken into consideration when predicting miRNA binding sites.},

The uShuffle tool achieves maximum flexibility by allowing arbitrary alphabet size and let size. It can be used as a command-line program, a web application, or a utility library. Source code in C, Java, and C{\#}, and integration instructions for Perl and Python are provided. The uShuffle tool surpasses existing implementation of the Euler algorithm in both performance and flexibility. It is a useful tool for the bioinformatics community.},

abstract = {Bcl-x is a member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins that are key regulators of apoptosis. The Bcl-x pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced to yield Bcl-x(S) and Bcl-x(L), two isoforms that have been associated, respectively, with the promotion and the prevention of apoptosis. We have investigated some of the elements and factors involved in the production of these two splice variants. Deletion mutagenesis using a human Bcl-x minigene identifies two regions in exon 2 that modulate Bcl-x 5'-splice site selection in human HeLa cells. One region (B3) is located upstream of the Bcl-x(L) 5'-splice site and enforces Bcl-x(L) production in cells and splicing extracts. The other region (B2) is located immediately downstream of the 5'-splice site of Bcl-x(S) and favors Bcl-x(S) production in vivo and in vitro. A 30-nucleotide G-rich element (B2G) is responsible for the activity of the B2 element. We show that recombinant heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) F and H proteins bind to B2G, and mutating the G stretches abolishes binding. Moreover, the addition of hnRNP F to a HeLa extract improved the production of the Bcl-x(S) variant in a manner that was dependent on the integrity of the G stretches in B2G. Consistent with the in vitro results, small interfering RNA-mediated RNA interference targeting hnRNP F and H decreased the Bcl-x(S)/Bcl-x(L) ratio of plasmid-derived and endogenously produced Bcl-x transcripts. Our results document a positive role for the hnRNP F/H proteins in the production of the proapoptotic regulator Bcl-x(S.).},

abstract = {Nucleosomes compact and regulate access to DNA in the nucleus, and are composed of approximately 147 bases of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer. Here we report a genome-wide nucleosome positioning analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana using massively parallel sequencing of mononucleosomes. By combining this data with profiles of DNA methylation at single base resolution, we identified 10-base periodicities in the DNA methylation status of nucleosome-bound DNA and found that nucleosomal DNA was more highly methylated than flanking DNA. These results indicate that nucleosome positioning influences DNA methylation patterning throughout the genome and that DNA methyltransferases preferentially target nucleosome-bound DNA. We also observed similar trends in human nucleosomal DNA, indicating that the relationships between nucleosomes and DNA methyltransferases are conserved. Finally, as has been observed in animals, nucleosomes were highly enriched on exons, and preferentially positioned at intron-exon and exon-intron boundaries. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) was also enriched on exons relative to introns, consistent with the hypothesis that nucleosome positioning regulates Pol II processivity. DNA methylation is also enriched on exons, consistent with the targeting of DNA methylation to nucleosomes, and suggesting a role for DNA methylation in exon definition.},

abstract = {Protein-coding genes in eukaryotes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and introns are removed from pre-mRNA by the spliceosome. Understanding the time lag between Pol II progression and splicing could provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of gene expression. Here, we present two single-molecule nascent RNA sequencing methods that directly determine the progress of splicing catalysis as a function of Pol II position. Endogenous genes were analyzed on a global scale in budding yeast. We show that splicing is 50{\%} complete when Pol II is only 45 nt downstream of introns, with the first spliced products observed as introns emerge from Pol II. Perturbations that slow the rate of spliceosome assembly or speed up the rate of transcription caused splicing delays, showing that regulation of both processes determines in vivo splicing profiles. We propose that matched rates streamline the gene expression pathway, while allowing regulation through kinetic competition.},

Because inactivating mutations of these genes are common in human pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs), we examined the telomere status of these tumors. We found that 61{\%} of PanNETs displayed abnormal telomeres that are characteristic of a telomerase-independent telomere maintenance mechanism termed ALT (alternative lengthening of telomeres). All of the PanNETs exhibiting these abnormal telomeres had ATRX or DAXX mutations or loss of nuclear ATRX or DAXX protein. ATRX mutations also correlate with abnormal telomeres in tumors of the central nervous system. These data suggest that an alternative telomere maintenance function may operate in human tumors with alterations in the ATRX or DAXX genes.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Testing for correlations between different sets of genomic features is a fundamental task in genomics research. However, searching for overlaps between features with existing web-based methods is complicated by the massive datasets that are routinely produced with current sequencing technologies. Fast and flexible tools are therefore required to ask complex questions of these data in an efficient manner. RESULTS This article introduces a new software suite for the comparison, manipulation and annotation of genomic features in Browser Extensible Data (BED) and General Feature Format (GFF) format. BEDTools also supports the comparison of sequence alignments in BAM format to both BED and GFF features. The tools are extremely efficient and allow the user to compare large datasets (e.g. next-generation sequencing data) with both public and custom genome annotation tracks. BEDTools can be combined with one another as well as with standard UNIX commands, thus facilitating routine genomics tasks as well as pipelines that can quickly answer intricate questions of large genomic datasets.

abstract = {ME1a1, a 16-base-pair nuclear factor binding site residing between the c-MYC P1 and P2 transcription initiation sites, is required for P2 activity. A cDNA encoding a 477-amino acid zinc finger protein designated MAZ (MYC-associated zinc finger protein) was cloned from a HeLa lambda gt11 library by screening with a concatamerized ME1a1 binding site probe. In addition to six potential zinc fingers of the Cys2His2 type, MAZ contains an amino-terminal proline-rich domain and several polyalanine tracts. Its mRNA was present in all human tissues tested except for kidney, as a doublet of approximately 2.5 and 2.7 kilobases, along with differentially expressed minor species. MAZ bound specifically to the wild-type ME1a1 sequence but not to a ME1a1 mutant that also failed to yield P2 activity. When expressed as a fusion protein in a pMAL-c vector, MAZ binds with specificity to a GA box sequence (GGGAGGG) found in the c-MYC P2 promoter, to the P2 attenuator region within the gene's first exon, and to a related sequence involved in the transcriptional termination of the C2 gene. MAZ may encode a transcription factor with dual roles in transcription initiation and termination.},

abstract = {The extent to which alternative splicing and long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) contribute to the specialized functions of cells within an organ is poorly understood. We generated a comprehensive dataset of gene expression from individual cell types of the Arabidopsis root. Comparisons across cell types revealed that alternative splicing tends to remove parts of coding regions from a longer, major isoform, providing evidence for a progressive mechanism of splicing. Cell-type-specific intron retention suggested a possible origin for this common form of alternative splicing. Coordinated alternative splicing across developmental stages pointed to a role in regulating differentiation. Consistent with this hypothesis, distinct isoforms of a transcription factor were shown to control developmental transitions. lincRNAs were generally lowly expressed at the level of individual cell types, but co-expression clusters provided clues as to their function. Our results highlight insights gained from analysis of expression at the level of individual cell types.},

Here we report the generation and characterization of an antibody fragment (iMab) that recognizes i-motif structures with high selectivity and affinity, enabling the detection of i-motifs in the nuclei of human cells. We demonstrate that the in vivo formation of such structures is cell-cycle and pH dependent. Furthermore, we provide evidence that i-motif structures are formed in regulatory regions of the human genome, including promoters and telomeric regions. Our results support the notion that i-motif structures provide key regulatory roles in the genome.},

Mutations in the hATRX gene cause severe syndromal mental retardation associated with alpha-thalassemia. Using indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy we have shown that ATRX protein is associated with pericentromeric heterochromatin during interphase and mitosis. By coimmunofluorescence, ATRX localizes with a mouse homologue of the Drosophila heterochromatic protein HP1 in vivo, consistent with a previous two-hybrid screen identifying this interaction. From the analysis of a trap assay for nuclear proteins, we have shown that the localization of ATRX to heterochromatin is encoded by its N-terminal region, which contains a conserved plant homeodomain-like finger and a coiled-coil domain. In addition to its association with heterochromatin, at metaphase ATRX clearly binds to the short arms of human acrocentric chromosomes, where the arrays of ribosomal DNA are located. The unexpected association of a putative transcriptional regulator with highly repetitive DNA provides a potential explanation for the variability in phenotype of patients with identical mutations in the ATRX gene.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) is a key regulatory mechanism that contributes to transcriptome and proteome diversity. As very few genome-wide studies analyzing AS in plants are available, we have performed high-throughput sequencing of a normalized cDNA library which resulted in a high coverage transcriptome map of Arabidopsis. We detect ∼150,000 splice junctions derived mostly from typical plant introns, including an eightfold increase in the number of U12 introns (2069). Around 61{\%} of multiexonic genes are alternatively spliced under normal growth conditions. Moreover, we provide experimental validation of 540 AS transcripts (from 256 genes coding for important regulatory factors) using high-resolution RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Intron retention (IR) is the most frequent AS event (∼40{\%}), but many IRs have relatively low read coverage and are less well-represented in assembled transcripts. Additionally, ∼51{\%} of Arabidopsis genes produce AS transcripts which do not involve IR. Therefore, the significance of IR in generating transcript diversity was generally overestimated in previous assessments. IR analysis allowed the identification of a large set of cryptic introns inside annotated coding exons. Importantly, a significant fraction of these cryptic introns are spliced out in frame, indicating a role in protein diversity. Furthermore, we show extensive AS coupled to nonsense-mediated decay in AFC2, encoding a highly conserved LAMMER kinase which phosphorylates splicing factors, thus establishing a complex loop in AS regulation. We provide the most comprehensive analysis of AS to date which will serve as a valuable resource for the plant community to study transcriptome complexity and gene regulation.},

abstract = {In angiosperms (as in other species), GC content varies along and between genes, within a genome, and between genomes of different species, but the reason for this distribution is still an open question. Grass genomes are particularly intriguing because they exhibit a strong bimodal distribution of genic GC content and a sharp 5'-3' decreasing GC content gradient along most genes. Here, we propose a unifying model to explain the main patterns of GC content variation at the gene and genome scale. We argue that GC content patterns could be mainly determined by the interactions between gene structure, recombination patterns, and GC-biased gene conversion. Recent studies on fine-scale recombination maps in angiosperms support this hypothesis and previous results also fit this model. We propose that our model could be used as a null hypothesis to search for additional forces that affect GC content in angiosperms.},

abstract = {The origin and importance of exon-intron architecture comprises one of the remaining mysteries of gene evolution. Several studies have investigated the variations of intron length, GC content, ordinal position in a gene and divergence. However, there is little study about the structural variation of exons and introns. We investigated the length, GC content, ordinal position and divergence in both exons and introns of 13 eukaryotic genomes, representing plant and animal. Our analyses revealed that three basic patterns of exon-intron variation were present in nearly all analyzed genomes (P {\textless} 0.001 in most cases): an ordinal reduction of length and divergence in both exon and intron, a co-variation between exon and its flanking introns in their length, GC content and divergence, and a decrease of average exon (or intron) length, GC content and divergence as the total exon numbers of a gene increased. In addition, we observed that the shorter introns had either low or high GC content, and the GC content of long introns was intermediate. Although the factors contributing to these patterns have not been identified, our results provide three important clues: common factor(s) exist and may shape both exons and introns; the ordinal reduction patterns may reflect a time-orderly evolution; and the larger first and last exons may be splicing-required. These clues provide a framework for elucidating mechanisms involved in the organization of eukaryotic genomes and particularly in building exon-intron structures.},

Strikingly, G4 DNA is a preferred substrate of the BLM helicase, as measured both by efficiency of unwinding and by competition. These results suggest that G4 DNA may be a natural substrate of BLM in vivo and that the failure to unwind G4 DNA may cause the genomic instability and increased frequency of sister chromatid exchange characteristic of Bloom's syndrome.},

abstract = {The third, or wobble, position in a codon provides a high degree of possible degeneracy and is an elegant fault-tolerance mechanism. Nucleotide biases between organisms at the wobble position have been documented and correlated with the abundances of the complementary tRNAs. We and others have noticed a bias for cytosine and guanine at the third position in a subset of transcripts within a single organism. The bias is present in some plant species and warm-blooded vertebrates but not in all plants, or in invertebrates or cold-blooded vertebrates. Here we demonstrate that in certain organisms the amount of GC at the wobble position (GC3) can be used to distinguish two classes of genes. We highlight the following features of genes with high GC3 content: they (1) provide more targets for methylation, (2) exhibit more variable expression, (3) more frequently possess upstream TATA boxes, (4) are predominant in certain classes of genes (e.g., stress responsive genes) and (5) have a GC3 content that increases from 5'to 3'. These observations led us to formulate a hypothesis to explain GC3 bimodality in grasses. Our findings suggest that high levels of GC3 typify a class of genes whose expression is regulated through DNA methylation or are a legacy of accelerated evolution through gene conversion. We discuss the three most probable explanations for GC3 bimodality: biased gene conversion, transcriptional and translational advantage and gene methylation.},

abstract = {Plants are used as representative reference biota for the biological assessment of environmental risks such as ionizing radiation due to their immobility. This study proposed a faster, more economical, and more effective method than conventional cytogenetic methods for the biological dosimetry of ionizing radiation in plants (phytodosimetry). We compared various dose-response curves for the radiation-induced DNA damage response (DDR) in Arabidopsis thaliana after relatively “low-dose” gamma irradiation (3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 Gy) below tens of Gy using comet (or single-cell gel electrophoresis), gamma-H2AX, and transcriptomic assays of seven DDR genes (AGO2, BRCA1, GRG, PARP1, RAD17, RAD51, and RPA1E) using quantitative real time PCR. The DDR signal from the comet assay was saturated at 6 Gy, while the gamma-H2AX signal increased up to 48 Gy, following a linear-quadratic dose-response model. The transcriptional changes in the seven DDR genes were fitted to linear or supra-linear quadratic equations with significant dose-dependency. The dose-dependent transcriptional changes were maintained similarly until 24 h after irradiation. The integrated transcriptional dose-response model of AGO2, BRCA1, GRG, and PARP1 was very similar to that of gamma-H2AX, while the transcriptional changes in the BRCA1, GRG, and PARP1 DDR genes revealed significant dependency on the dose-rate, ecotype, and radiation dose. These results suggest that the transcriptome-based dose-response model fitted to a quadratic equation could be used practically for phytodosimetry instead of conventional cytogenetic models, such as the comet and gamma-H2AX assays. The effects of dose-rate and ecotype on the transcriptional changes of DDR genes should also be considered to improve the transcriptome-based phytodosimetry model.},

Recent studies provide strong evidence for the formation and function of DNA and RNA GQSs in human cells. However, whether GQSs form and are functional in plants remains essentially unexplored. On the basis of circular dichroism (CD)-detected titration, UV-detected melting, in-line probing (ILP) and reporter gene assay studies, we report the first example of a plant RNA GQS that inhibits translation. This GQS is located within the 5'-UTR of the ATAXIA TELANGIECTASIA-MUTATED AND RAD3-RELATED (ATR) mRNA of Arabidopsis thaliana (mouse-ear cress). We show that this GQS is highly stable and is thermodynamically favoured over a competing hairpin structure in the 5'-UTR at physiological K⁺ and Mg²⁺ concentrations. Results from ILP reveal the secondary structure of the RNA and support formation of the GQS in vitro in the context of the complete 5'-UTR. Transient reporter gene assays performed in living plants reveal that the GQS inhibits translation but not transcription, implicating this GQS as a translational repressor in vivo. Our results provide the first complete demonstration of the formation and function of a regulatory RNA GQS in plants and open new avenues to explore potential functional roles of GQS in the plant kingdom.},

@article{Roberts1992,
abstract = {Studies of a series of short oligonucleotide double and triple helices containing either all RNA, all DNA, or a mixture of the two show strand-dependent variation in their stability and structure. The variation in stability for both groups falls over a range of greater than 10 kilocalories per mole. In forming the triple helix, RNA is favored on both pyrimidine strands, whereas DNA is favored on the purine strand. In general, relatively unstable duplexes form particularly stable triplexes and vice versa. Structural data indicate thatthe strands in hybrid helices adopt a conformation that is intermediate between molecules containing all DNA and all RNA. Thus, RNA-DNA hybrids were not forced into the conformation of the RNA (A-form). The provocative stability of the triplex with an RNA third strand + DNA duplex points to novel antisense strategies and opens the possibility of an in vivo role of these structures. Overall, the data emphasize the fundamental role of sugars in determining the properties of nucleic acid complexes. Intermolecular triple helix formation has been implicated as a possible means of controlling cellular processes, either by an endogenous or exogenous mechanism. Tri-plexes have been shown to inhibit protein-DNA interaction and function in vitro (1), and there is evidence for similar inhibition in vivo (2). Functional triplexes could in principle be formed from some combination of RNA and DNA strands. However, relatively little is known about the role of strand composition, or even which complexes are stable. We report that there are dramatic differences in the stability and other properties of DNA, RNA, and hybrid duplexes and triplexes made from oligonu-cleotides. A simple view of the structure of RNA-DNA hybrid double and triple helices is that all strands are A form, with a C-3'endo sugar pucker. The rationale is that DNA can adopt either A-or B-form geometry (C-3'endo and C-2'endo sugar puckers, respectively), whereas RNA is overwhelmingly seen in the A form. Hybrids should thus adopt an A-form geometry to conform to the RNA strand. The single x-ray structure available for an RNA-DNA hybrid duplex supports this notion (3). The molecule contains both hybrid regions and all DNA duplex regions, all of which are A form. Similarly, fiber diffraction of homo and hybrid triplexes indicates that at high humidity they are all A form and have 11-or 12-fold helices with pitches ranging from 3.06 to 3.26 A (4). However, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (5) and fiber diffraction (6) of hybrid duplexes and NMR of DNA triplex-es (7) demonstrate the heteronomous nature of their structures (individual strands differ in their sugar pucker). In hybrid duplexes, the RNA strand appears C-3'endo (A-like), whereas the DNA strand does not (5). In DNA triple helices, the pyrimidine (Py) strands show a mixture of C-3'endo and C-2'endo sugar puckers, whereas the purine (Pu) strand is almost completely C-2'endo (B-like) (7). We show by comparative electrophoresis and circular dichroism (CD) measurements on homo and hybrid duplexes and triplexes that there is a gradient of structure between all-DNA and all-RNA helices. Triplex thermodynamics was measured either as the free energy (AG0) of binding the third strand to a duplex (triplex stability) or as the total AG' of forming triplex from the component single strands (total stability). These two measures turn out to be quite different. We find a general, if imperfect, anticorrelation between triplex stability and the stability of the underlying duplex. Relative instability appears to char-A' acterize duplexes with hightriplex stability, perhaps because the duplex structure is compatible with third-strand binding. Correspondingly , the energy required to distort the more stable duplex structures to form the triplex may be the source of their relative triplex instability. Total stability is markedly greater for triplexes in which the third strand is RNA. The observed variability in the complexes must lie in the chemical differences between RNA and DNA: the 2'OH and the thymine methyl groups, respectively. RNA should be favored where the preferred geometry is C-3'endo, and DNA should be favored when it is C-2'endo or when the hydrophobic effect plays a role (from burial of the thymine methyl). A methyl group on the 5 position of the pyrimidine ring has been shown to be stabilizing in the case of cytosine for the triple helix (8), probably because of the hydrophobic effect rather than alteration of the pKa of cytosine (9). We used oligonucleotide constructs consisting of a hairpin duplex with 5' Pu and 3' Py ends, and a Py third strand (10). The molecules synthesized (see Fig. 1) include four hairpin duplexes: (i) all DNA [DD]; (ii) all RNA [RRJ; (iii) DNA Pu strand + RNA Py strand [DRI; and (iv) RNA Pu strand + DNA Py strand IRD]. In addition, there are two all-Py third strands: (i) all DNA [D]; and (ii) all RNA [R] (11). All eight possible combinations of duplex with third strand were tested. Only six of the eight possible triplexes could be formed. Illustrative melting curves taken at pH 5.5 for these complexes are shown in Fig. 2. In the case for the two triplexes that do not form (D + RD, D + RR), only the transition corresponding to self-structure of the DNA Py strand (melt-ing temperature Tm = 22MC, half-height width of derivative melting curve = 11 .0C) is seen at low temperature. Van't Hoff analysis, with the all or none approximation , was used to determine the stan-B T-AT C+-GC Fig. 1. Schematic of sequences and base interactions. (A) Diagram of the four hairpin duplexes and two third strands that were studied. DNA is denoted by solid characters and RNA by open ones. (B) Base interactions in the two-pyrimidine triple helix. The third strand is listed first. The T-AT triple is shown; triples containing uracil differ only in the absence of the 5-methyl group on the ring.},

abstract = {Guanine-rich DNA sequences of a particular form have the ability to fold into four-stranded structures called G-quadruplexes. In this paper, we present a working rule to predict which primary sequences can form this structure, and describe a search algorithm to identify such sequences in genomic DNA. We count the number of quadruplexes found in the human genome and compare that with the figure predicted by modelling DNA as a Bernoulli stream or as a Markov chain, using windows of various sizes. We demonstrate that the distribution of loop lengths is significantly different from what would be expected in a random case, providing an indication of the number of potentially relevant quadruplex-forming sequences. In particular, we show that there is a significant repression of quadruplexes in the coding strand of exonic regions, which suggests that quadruplex-forming patterns are disfavoured in sequences that will form RNA.},

UMAP is constructed from a theoretical framework based in Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. The result is a practical scalable algorithm that applies to real world data. The UMAP algorithm is competitive with t-SNE for visualization quality, and arguably preserves more of the global structure with superior run time performance. Furthermore, UMAP as described has no computational restrictions on embedding dimension, making it viable as a general purpose dimension reduction technique for machine learning.},

abstract = {We describe a sequence-based computational model to predict DNA G-quadruplex (G4) formation. The model was developed using large-scale machine learning from an extensive experimental G4-formation dataset, recently obtained for the human genome via G4-seq methodology. Our model differentiates many widely accepted putative quadruplex sequences that do not actually form stable genomic G4 structures, correctly assessing the G4 folding potential of over 700,000 such sequences in the human genome. Moreover, our approach reveals the relative importance of sequence-based features coming from both within the G4 motifs and their flanking regions. The developed model can be applied to any DNA sequence or genome to characterise sequence-driven intramolecular G4 formation propensities.},
