abstract = {BLM and WRN, the products of the Bloom's and Werner's syndrome genes, are members of the RecQ family of DNA helicases. Although both have been shown previously to unwind simple, partial duplex DNA substrates with 3'--{\textgreater}5' polarity, little is known about the structural features of DNA that determine the substrate specificities of these enzymes. We have compared the substrate specificities of the BLM and WRN proteins using a variety of partial duplex DNA molecules, which are based upon a common core nucleotide sequence. We show that neither BLM nor WRN is capable of unwinding duplex DNA from a blunt-ended terminus or from an internal nick. However, both enzymes efficiently unwind the same blunt-ended duplex containing a centrally located 12 nt single-stranded 'bubble', as well as a synthetic X-structure (a model for the Holliday junction recombination intermediate) in which each 'arm' of the 4-way junction is blunt-ended. Surprisingly, a 3'-tailed duplex, a standard substrate for 3'--{\textgreater}5' helicases, is unwound much less efficiently by BLM and WRN than are the bubble and X-structure substrates. These data show conclusively that a single-stranded 3'-tail is not a structural requirement for unwinding of standard B-form DNA by these helicases. BLM and WRN also both unwind a variety of different forms of G-quadruplex DNA, a structure that can form at guanine-rich sequences present at several genomic loci. Our data indicate that BLM and WRN are atypical helicases that are highly DNA structure specific and have similar substrate specificities. We interpret these data in the light of the genomic instability and hyper-recombination characteristics of cells from individuals with Bloom's or Werner's syndrome.},

abstract = {The first plant glycine–rich proteins (GRPs) have been isolated more than 20 years ago based on their specific expression pattern and/or modulation by several biotic and abiotic factors. This superfamily is characterized by the presence of a glycine-rich domain arranged in (Gly)n-X repeats. The presence of additional motifs, as well as the nature of the glycine repeats, groups them in different classes. The diversity in structure as well as in expression pattern, modulation and sub-cellular localization have always indicated that these proteins, although classified as members of the same superfamily, would perform different functions in planta. Only now, two decades later, with the first functional characterizations of plant GRPs their involvement in diverse biological and biochemical processes are being uncovered. Here, we review the so far ascribed functions of plant GRPs.},

abstract = {To safeguard genetic integrity, cells have evolved an accurate but not failsafe mechanism of DNA replication. Not all DNA sequences tolerate DNA replication equally well [1]. Also, genomic regions that impose structural barriers to the DNA replication fork are a potential source of genetic instability [2, 3]. Here, we demonstrate that G4 DNA—a sequence motif that folds into quadruplex structures in vitro [4, 5]—is highly mutagenic in vivo and is removed from genomes that lack dog-1, the C. elegans ortholog of mammalian FANCJ [6, 7], which is mutated in Fanconi anemia patients [8–11]. We show that sequences that match the G4 DNA signature G3-5N1-3G3-5N1-3G3-5N1-3G3-5 are deleted in germ and somatic tissues of dog-1 animals. Unbiased aCGH analyses of dog-1 genomes that were allowed to accumulate mutations in {\textgreater}100 replication cycles indicate that deletions are found exclusively at G4 DNA; deletion frequencies can reach 4{\%} per site per animal generation. We found that deletion sizes fall short of Okazaki fragment lengths [12], and no significant microhomology was observed at deletion junctions. The existence of 376,000 potentially mutagenic G4 DNA sites in the human genome could have major implications for the etiology of hereditary FancJ and nonhereditary cancers.},

abstract = {In this review, we give an overview of recent literature on the structure and stability of unimolecular G-rich quadruplex structures that are relevant to drug design and for in vivo function. The unifying theme in this review is energetics. The thermodynamic stability of quadruplexes has not been studied in the same detail as DNA and RNA duplexes, and there are important differences in the balance of forces between these classes of folded oligonucleotides. We provide an overview of the principles of stability and where available the experimental data that report on these principles. Significant gaps in the literature have been identified, that should be filled by a systematic study of well-defined quadruplexes not only to provide the basic understanding of stability both for design purposes, but also as it relates to in vivo occurrence of quadruplexes. Techniques that are commonly applied to the determination of the structure, stability and folding are discussed in terms of information content and limitations. Quadruplex structures fold and unfold comparatively slowly, and DNA unwinding events associated with transcription and replication may be operating far from equilibrium. The kinetics of formation and resolution of quadruplexes, and methodologies are discussed in the context of stability and their possible biological occurrence.},

@article{Garant2015,
abstract = {G-quadruplexes (G4) are tetrahelical structures formed from planar arrangement of guanines in nucleic acids. A simple, regular motif was originally proposed to describe G4-forming sequences. More recently, however, formation of G4 was discovered to depend, at least in part, on the contextual backdrop of neighboring sequences. Prediction of G4 folding is thus becoming more challenging as G4 outlier structures, not described by the originally proposed motif, are increasingly reported. Recent observations thus call for a comprehensive tool, capable of consolidating the expanding information on tested G4s, in order to conduct systematic comparative analyses of G4-promoting sequences. The G4RNA Database we propose was designed to help meet the need for easily-retrievable data on known RNA G4s. A user-friendly, flexible query system allows for data retrieval on experimentally tested sequences, from many separate genes, to assess G4-folding potential. Query output sorts data according to sequence position, G4 likelihood, experimental outcomes and associated bibliographical references. G4RNA also provides an ideal foundation to collect and store additional sequence and experimental data, considering the growing interest G4s currently generate.Database URL: scottgroup.med.usherbrooke.ca/G4RNA.},

abstract = {In angiosperms (as in other species), GC content varies along and between genes, within a genome, and between genomes of different species, but the reason for this distribution is still an open question. Grass genomes are particularly intriguing because they exhibit a strong bimodal distribution of genic GC content and a sharp 5'-3' decreasing GC content gradient along most genes. Here, we propose a unifying model to explain the main patterns of GC content variation at the gene and genome scale. We argue that GC content patterns could be mainly determined by the interactions between gene structure, recombination patterns, and GC-biased gene conversion. Recent studies on fine-scale recombination maps in angiosperms support this hypothesis and previous results also fit this model. We propose that our model could be used as a null hypothesis to search for additional forces that affect GC content in angiosperms.},

In this paper, we present a working rule to predict which primary sequences can form this structure, and describe a search algorithm to identify such sequences in genomic DNA. We count the number of quadruplexes found in the human genome and compare that with the figure predicted by modelling DNA as a Bernoulli stream or as a Markov chain, using windows of various sizes. We demonstrate that the distribution of loop lengths is significantly different from what would be expected in a random case, providing an indication of the number of potentially relevant quadruplex-forming sequences. In particular, we show that there is a significant repression of quadruplexes in the coding strand of exonic regions, which suggests that quadruplex-forming patterns are disfavoured in sequences that will form RNA.},

abstract = {We present the solution structure of d(CCCTA 2 CCCTA 2 CCCTA 2 CCCT), a fragment of the vertebrate telomere which folds intramolecularly. The four cytidine stretches form an i-motif which includes six intercalated C{\'{A}}C  pairs and terminates with the cytidines at the 5 H extremity of each stretch. Above, the second TA 2 linker loops across one of the narrow grooves, while at the bottom, the {\textregistered}rst and third linkers loop across the wide grooves. At 30 C, the spectra of the {\textregistered}rst and third linkers are quasi-degenerate. Severe broadening at lower temperature indicates that this results from motional averaging between at least two structures of each bottom loop, and makes it impossible to solve the con{\textregistered}guration of the bottom loops directly, in contrast to the rest of the structure. We therefore turned to the modi{\textregistered}ed sequence d(CCCTA 2 5mCCC-TA 2 CCCUA 2 CCCT) in which the two base substitutions (underlined) break the quasi-symmetry between linkers 1 and 3. The three loops follow approximately the hairpin``hairpin``second pattern'' of Hilbers. In the {\textregistered}rst loop, T4 is in the syn orientation, whereas its analog in the third loop, U16, oriented anti, is in a central location, where it interacts with bases of both loops, thus contributing to their tight association. The only motion is a syn/anti ¯ip of A18 in the third loop. Returning to the telomere fragment, we show that each of the bottom loops switches between the structures identi{\textregistered}ed in the {\textregistered}rst and third loops of the modi{\textregistered}ed structure. The motions are concerted, and the resulting con{\textregistered}gurations of the bottom loop cluster present a bulge to either right (T4 syn) or left (T16 syn).},

abstract = {Changes in RNA conformation can alter gene expression. The guanine quadruplex sequence (GQS) is an RNA motif that folds in the presence of K(+) ions. Changes in the conformation of this motif could be especially important in regulating gene expression in plants because intracellular K(+) concentrations often increase during drought stress. Little is known about the folding thermodynamics of RNA GQS. We show here that RNA GQS with tracts containing three G's [e.g., (GGGxx)(4)] have a modest dependence on the K(+) concentration, folding with no or even negative cooperativity (Hill coefficients ≤1), and are associated with populated folding intermediates. In contrast, GQS with tracts containing just two G's [e.g., (GGxx)(4)] have a steep dependence on the K(+) concentration and fold with positive cooperativity (Hill coefficients of 1.7-2.7) without significantly populating intermediate states. We postulate that in plants, the more stable G3 sequences are largely folded even under unstressed conditions, while the less stable G2 sequences fold only at the higher K(+) concentrations associated with cellular stress, wherein they respond sharply to changing K(+) concentrations. Given the binary nature of their folding, G2 sequences may find application in computation with DNA and in engineering of genetic circuits.},

Additionally, utilization of a specific combination of G-tracts within this segment allows for the conformational switch that implies a tunable regulatory role of the quadruplex structure in translation initiation. A sequence engineered from a functionally handicapped mutant moderately rescued the activity, further indicating the importance of G-quadruplex structure for VEGF IRES-A function.

abstract = {The rate of transcription elongation plays an important role in the timing of expression of full-length transcripts as well as in the regulation of alternative splicing. In this study, we coupled Bru-seq technology with 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole 1-$\beta$-D-ribofuranoside (DRB) to estimate the elongation rates of over 2000 individual genes in human cells. This technique, BruDRB-seq, revealed gene-specific differences in elongation rates with a median rate of around 1.5 kb/min. We found that genes with rapid elongation rates showed higher densities of H3K79me2 and H4K20me1 histone marks compared to slower elongating genes. Furthermore, high elongation rates had a positive correlation with gene length, low complexity DNA sequence, and distance from the nearest active transcription unit. Features that negatively correlated with elongation rate included the density of exons, long terminal repeats, GC content of the gene, and DNA methylation density in the bodies of genes. Our results suggest that some static gene features influence transcription elongation rates and that cells may alter elongation rates by epigenetic regulation. The BruDRB-seq technique offers new opportunities to interrogate mechanisms of regulation of transcription elongation.},

abstract = {G-quadruplexes (GQs) are alternative DNA secondary structures that can form throughout the human genome and control the replication and transcription of important regulatory genes. Here, we established an ensemble fluorescence assay by employing two GQ-interacting compounds, N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMM) and Crystal Violet (CV). This enables quantitative measurement of the GQ folding propensity and conformation specificity in both single strand (ss) and double strand (ds) DNA. Our GQ mapping indicates that the likelihood of GQ formation is substantially diminished in dsDNA, likely due to the competition from the Watson-Crick base pairing. Unlike GQ folding sequence in ssDNA which forms both parallel and antiparallel GQs, dsDNA displays only parallel folding. Additionally, we employed single molecule FRET to obtain a direct quantitation of stably formed-, weakly folded and unfolded GQ conformations. The findings of this study and the method developed here will enable identifying and classifying potential GQ-forming sequences in human genome.},

abstract = {N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMM) is exceptionally selective for G-quadruplexes (GQ) relative to duplex DNA and, as such, has found a wide range of applications in biology and chemistry. In addition, NMM is selective for parallel versus antiparallel GQ folds, as was recently demonstrated in our laboratory. Here, we present the X-ray crystal structure of a complex between NMM and human telomeric DNA dAGGG(TTAGGG)(3), Tel22, determined in two space groups, P2(1)2(1)2 and P6, at 1.65 and 2.15 {\AA} resolution, respectively. The former is the highest resolution structure of the human telomeric GQ DNA reported to date. The biological unit contains a Tel22 dimer of 5'-5' stacked parallel-stranded quadruplexes capped on both ends with NMM, supporting the spectroscopically determined 1:1 stoichiometry. NMM is capable of adjusting its macrocycle geometry to closely match that of the terminal G-tetrad required for efficient $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking. The out-of-plane N-methyl group of NMM fits perfectly into the center of the parallel GQ core where it aligns with potassium ions. In contrast, the interaction of the N-methyl group with duplex DNA or antiparallel GQ would lead to steric clashes that prevent NMM from binding to these structures, thus explaining its unique selectivity. On the basis of the biochemical data, binding of NMM to Tel22 does not rely on relatively nonspecific electrostatic interactions, which characterize most canonical GQ ligands, but rather it is hydrophobic in nature. The structural features observed in the NMM-Tel22 complex described here will serve as guidelines for developing new quadruplex ligands that have excellent affinity and precisely defined selectivity.},

abstract = {PRIMARY cell walls contain a protein, extensin, which is rich in trans 4-L-hydroxyproline1–3. I suggested earlier that this protein could cross link wall polysaccharides4; if some of these cross linkages were labile, it would provide a chemical basis for changes in cell wall plasticity which are necessary for extension of plant cells. The recent isolation of several glycopeptides, rich in hydroxyproline from enzymatic digests of tomato cell walls5, confirmed the inference of a covalent carbohydrate–protein linkage in extensin. The chemical composition and properties of these glycopeptides also led me to the preliminary conclusion that attachment of the carbohydrate is by a glycosidic link through the hydroxyl group of hydroxyproline5. This rather unexpected possibility receives additional support from results presented in this communication, describing the isolation of hydroxyproline-O-glycosides from partial alkaline hydrolysates of tomato cell walls. These cell wall preparations account for more than 95 per cent of the hydroxyproline of the cells3. Most of this hydroxyproline (about 70 per cent) can be released as hydroxyproline glycosides. The method is based on the fact that glycosidic linkages are usually stable to those alkaline conditions which lead to rapid hydrolysis of peptide bonds6.},

abstract = {Bcl-x is a member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins that are key regulators of apoptosis. The Bcl-x pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced to yield Bcl-x(S) and Bcl-x(L), two isoforms that have been associated, respectively, with the promotion and the prevention of apoptosis. We have investigated some of the elements and factors involved in the production of these two splice variants. Deletion mutagenesis using a human Bcl-x minigene identifies two regions in exon 2 that modulate Bcl-x 5'-splice site selection in human HeLa cells. One region (B3) is located upstream of the Bcl-x(L) 5'-splice site and enforces Bcl-x(L) production in cells and splicing extracts. The other region (B2) is located immediately downstream of the 5'-splice site of Bcl-x(S) and favors Bcl-x(S) production in vivo and in vitro. A 30-nucleotide G-rich element (B2G) is responsible for the activity of the B2 element. We show that recombinant heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) F and H proteins bind to B2G, and mutating the G stretches abolishes binding. Moreover, the addition of hnRNP F to a HeLa extract improved the production of the Bcl-x(S) variant in a manner that was dependent on the integrity of the G stretches in B2G. Consistent with the in vitro results, small interfering RNA-mediated RNA interference targeting hnRNP F and H decreased the Bcl-x(S)/Bcl-x(L) ratio of plasmid-derived and endogenously produced Bcl-x transcripts. Our results document a positive role for the hnRNP F/H proteins in the production of the proapoptotic regulator Bcl-x(S.).},

abstract = {The RNA binding protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) F is involved in telomeres maintenance and pre-mRNA processing, such as alternative splicing and polyadenylation. It specifically recognizes RNA containing three consecutive guanines (G-tracts) that have the potential to assemble into G-quadruplexes. We have proposed recently that hnRNP F could regulate alternative splicing by remodeling RNA structures, such as G-quadruplexes. However, the exact mechanism of hnRNP F binding to such RNA sequences remains unknown. Here, we have studied the binding of the third RNA binding domain of hnRNP F [quasi-RNA recognition motif 3 (qRRM3)] to G-tract RNA using isothermal titration calorimetry, circular dichroism and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our results show that qRRM3 binds specifically exclusively to single-stranded G-tracts (ssRNA), in contrast to previous reports stating that the G-quadruplex was recognized as well. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the pre-existent ssRNA/G-quadruplex equilibrium slows down the formation of the protein-ssRNA complex. Based on in vitro transcription assays, we show that the rate of the protein-RNA complex formation is faster than that of the G-quadruplex. We propose a model according to which hnRNP F could bind RNA co-transcriptionally and prevents G-quadruplex formation.},

abstract = {Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, which can assemble on pre-mRNA cotranscriptionally. However, whether splicing generally occurs during transcription has not been addressed. Indeed, splicing catalysis is expected to occur posttranscriptionally in yeast, where the shortness of terminal exons should leave insufficient time for splicing. Here, we isolate endogenous S. cerevisiae nascent RNA and determine gene-specific splicing efficiencies and transcription profiles, using high-density tiling microarrays. Surprisingly, we find that splicing occurs cotranscriptionally for the majority of intron-containing genes. Analysis of transcription profiles reveals Pol II pausing within the terminal exons of these genes. Intronless and inefficiently spliced genes lack this pause. In silico simulations of transcription and splicing kinetics confirm that this pausing event provides sufficient time for splicing before termination. The discovery of terminal exon pausing demonstrates functional coupling of transcription and splicing near gene ends. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

It has previously been shown that a target's availability to miRNA can be affected by its structure. G-quadruplexes (G4) are noncanonical structures adopted by G-rich nucleic acids that have been shown to have multiple biological functions. In this study, whether or not G4 structures' presence in the 3' UTRs of mRNAs can hinder miRNA binding was investigated. Putative G4 overlapping with predicted miRNAs' binding sites was searched for, and 44,294 hits were found in humans. The FADS2 mRNA/mir331-3p pair was selected as a model example. In-line probing and G4-specific fluorescent ligand experiments binding were performed and confirmed the presence of a G4 near the predicted miRNA binding site. Subsequent luciferase assays showed that the presence of the G4 prevents the binding of mir331-3p in cellulo. Together, these results served as proof of concept that a G4 structure present in a 3' UTR sequence should be taken into consideration when predicting miRNA binding sites.},

Strikingly, G4 DNA is a preferred substrate of the BLM helicase, as measured both by efficiency of unwinding and by competition. These results suggest that G4 DNA may be a natural substrate of BLM in vivo and that the failure to unwind G4 DNA may cause the genomic instability and increased frequency of sister chromatid exchange characteristic of Bloom's syndrome.},

Recent studies provide strong evidence for the formation and function of DNA and RNA GQSs in human cells. However, whether GQSs form and are functional in plants remains essentially unexplored. On the basis of circular dichroism (CD)-detected titration, UV-detected melting, in-line probing (ILP) and reporter gene assay studies, we report the first example of a plant RNA GQS that inhibits translation. This GQS is located within the 5'-UTR of the ATAXIA TELANGIECTASIA-MUTATED AND RAD3-RELATED (ATR) mRNA of Arabidopsis thaliana (mouse-ear cress). We show that this GQS is highly stable and is thermodynamically favoured over a competing hairpin structure in the 5'-UTR at physiological K⁺ and Mg²⁺ concentrations. Results from ILP reveal the secondary structure of the RNA and support formation of the GQS in vitro in the context of the complete 5'-UTR. Transient reporter gene assays performed in living plants reveal that the GQS inhibits translation but not transcription, implicating this GQS as a translational repressor in vivo. Our results provide the first complete demonstration of the formation and function of a regulatory RNA GQS in plants and open new avenues to explore potential functional roles of GQS in the plant kingdom.},

This motif confers the ability to form an unusual four-stranded DNA structure, G4 DNA. G4 DNA is associated with genomic instability, which may explain depletion of G4 motifs from some genes and genomic regions. Conversely, G4 motifs are enriched downstream of transcription start sites, where they correlate with pausing. The uneven distribution of G4 motifs in the genome strongly suggests that mechanisms of selection act not only on one-dimensional genomic sequence, but also on structures formed by genomic DNA. The biological roles of G4 structures illustrate that, to understand genome function, it is important to consider the dynamic structural potential implicit in the G4 motif.},

abstract = {Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a mediator of aggressive phenotype in pancreatic cancer. On the basis of our finding that knockdown of either KRAS or ILK has a reciprocal effect on the other's expression, we hypothesized the presence of an ILK-KRAS regulatory loop that enables pancreatic cancer cells to regulate KRAS expression. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism by which this regulatory circuitry is regulated and to investigate the translational potential of targeting ILK to suppress oncogenic KRAS signaling in pancreatic cancer. Interplay between KRAS and ILK and the roles of E2F1, c-Myc and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein as intermediary effectors in this feedback loop was interrogated by genetic manipulations through small interfering RNA/short hairpin RNA knockdown and ectopic expression, western blotting, PCR, promoter-luciferase reporter assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation and pull-down analyses. In vivo efficacy of ILK inhibition was evaluated in two murine xenograft models. Our data show that KRAS regulated the expression of ILK through E2F1-mediated transcriptional activation, which, in turn, controlled KRAS gene expression via hnRNPA1-mediated destabilization of the G-quadruplex on the KRAS promoter. Moreover, ILK inhibition blocked KRAS-driven epithelial–mesenchymal transition and growth factor-stimulated KRAS expression. The knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of ILK suppressed pancreatic tumor growth, in part, by suppressing KRAS signaling. These studies suggest that this KRAS-E2F1-ILK-hnRNPA1 regulatory loop enables pancreatic cancer cells to promote oncogenic KRAS signaling and to interact with the tumor microenvironment to promote aggressive phenotypes. This regulatory loop provides a mechanistic rationale for targeting ILK to suppress oncogenic KRAS signaling, which might foster new therapeutic strategies for pancreatic cancer.},

Potential quadruplex sequences have been identified in G-rich eukaryotic telomeres, and more recently in non-telomeric genomic DNA, e.g. in nuclease-hypersensitive promoter regions. The natural role and biological validation of these structures is starting to be explored, and there is particular interest in them as targets for therapeutic intervention. This survey focuses on the folding and structural features on quadruplexes formed from telomeric and non-telomeric DNA sequences, and examines fundamental aspects of topology and the emerging relationships with sequence. Emphasis is placed on information from the high-resolution methods of X-ray crystallography and NMR, and their scope and current limitations are discussed. Such information, together with biological insights, will be important for the discovery of drugs targeting quadruplexes from particular genes.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) is used extensively to characterize the transcriptome of cells. Many transcriptomic studies aim at comparing either abundance levels or the transcriptome composition between given conditions, and as a first step, the sequencing reads must be used as the basis for abundance quantification of transcriptomic features of interest, such as genes or transcripts. Several different quantification approaches have been proposed, ranging from simple counting of reads that overlap given genomic regions to more complex estimation of underlying transcript abundances. In this paper, we show that gene-level abundance estimates and statistical inference offer advantages over transcript-level analyses, in terms of performance and interpretability. We also illustrate that while the presence of differential isoform usage can lead to inflated false discovery rates in differential expression analyses on simple count matrices and transcript-level abundance estimates improve the performance in simulated data, the difference is relatively minor in several real data sets. Finally, we provide an R package ( tximport ) to help users integrate transcript-level abundance estimates from common quantification pipelines into count-based statistical inference engines.},

We introduce StringTie, a computational method that applies a network flow algorithm originally developed in optimization theory, together with optional de novo assembly, to assemble these complex data sets into transcripts. When used to analyze both simulated and real data sets, StringTie produces more complete and accurate reconstructions of genes and better estimates of expression levels, compared with other leading transcript assembly programs including Cufflinks, IsoLasso, Scripture and Traph. For example, on 90 million reads from human blood, StringTie correctly assembled 10,990 transcripts, whereas the next best assembly was of 7,187 transcripts by Cufflinks, which is a 53{\%} increase in transcripts assembled. On a simulated data set, StringTie correctly assembled 7,559 transcripts, which is 20{\%} more than the 6,310 assembled by Cufflinks. As well as producing a more complete transcriptome assembly, StringTie runs faster on all data sets tested to date compared with other assembly software, including Cufflinks.},

abstract = {Recent advances in sequencing techniques that measure nascent transcripts and that reveal the positioning of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) have shown that the pausing of Pol II in promoter-proximal regions and its release to initiate a phase of productive elongation are key steps in transcription regulation. Moreover, after the release of Pol II from the promoter-proximal region, elongation rates are highly dynamic throughout the transcription of a gene, and vary on a gene-by-gene basis. Interestingly, Pol II elongation rates affect co-transcriptional processes such as splicing, termination and genome stability. Increasing numbers of factors and regulatory mechanisms have been associated with the steps of transcription elongation by Pol II, revealing that elongation is a highly complex process. Elongation is thus now recognized as a key phase in the regulation of transcription by Pol II.},

Here we characterize the plant NatA complex and reveal evolutionary conservation of NatA biochemical properties in higher eukaryotes and uncover specific and essential functions of NatA for development, biosynthetic pathways and stress responses in plants. We show that NTA decreases significantly after drought stress, and NatA abundance is rapidly downregulated by the phytohormone abscisic acid. Accordingly, transgenic downregulation of NatA induces the drought stress response and results in strikingly drought resistant plants. Thus, we propose that NTA by the NatA complex acts as a cellular surveillance mechanism during stress and that imprinting of the proteome by NatA is an important switch for the control of metabolism, development and cellular stress responses downstream of abscisic acid.},

It is, however, a multifunctional protein that, depending on the cellular context, can drive either cell proliferation or apoptosis. Our laboratory recently demonstrated that nucleolin can function as a repressor of c-MYC transcription by binding to and stabilizing the formation of a G-quadruplex structure in a region of the c-MYC promoter responsible for controlling 85-90{\%} of c-MYC's transcriptional activity. In this study, we investigate the structural elements of nucleolin that are required for c-MYC repression. The effect of nucleolin deletion mutants on the formation and stability of the c-MYC G-quadruplex, as well as c-MYC transcriptional activity, was assessed by circular dichroism spectropolarimetry, thermal stability, and in vitro transcription. Here we report that nucleolin's RNA binding domains 3 and 4, as well as the arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) domain, are required to repress c-MYC transcription.},

When stably transfected into an IL-3- dependent cell line, bcl-xL inhibits cell death upon growth factor withdrawal at least as well as bcl-2. Surprisingly, the second mRNA species, bcl-xS, encodes a protein that inhibits the ability of bcl-2 to enhance the survival of growth factor-deprived cells. In vivo, bcl- xS mRNA is expressed at high levels in cells that undergo a high rate of turnover, such as developing lymphocytes. In contrast, bcl-xL is found in tissues containing long-lived postmitotic cells, such as adult brain. Together these data suggest that bcl-x plays an important role in both positive and negative regulation of programmed cell death.},

Eighty-seven percent of the introns assayed manifest {\textgreater}50{\%} cotranscriptional splicing. The remaining 13{\%} are cotranscriptionally spliced poorly or slowly, with ∼3{\%} being almost completely retained in nascent pre-mRNA. Although individual introns showed slight but statistically significant differences in splicing efficiency, similar global levels of splicing were seen from both sources. Importantly, introns with low cotranscriptional splicing efficiencies are present in the same primary transcript with efficiently spliced introns, indicating that splicing is intron-specific. The analysis also indicates that cotranscriptional splicing is less efficient for first introns, longer introns, and introns annotated as alternative. Finally, S2 cells expressing the slow RpII215(C4) mutant show substantially less intron retention than wild-type S2 cells.},

We generated an extensive catalog of nascent and steady-state transcripts in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings using global nuclear run-on sequencing (GRO-seq), 5'GRO-seq, and RNA-seq and reanalyzed published maize data to capture characteristics of plant transcription. De novo annotation of nascent transcripts accurately mapped start sites and unstable transcripts. Examining the promoters of coding and noncoding transcripts identified comparable chromatin signatures, a conserved "TGT" core promoter motif and unreported transcription factor-binding sites. Mapping of engaged RNA polymerases showed a lack of enhancer RNAs, promoter-proximal pausing, and divergent transcription in Arabidopsis seedlings and maize, which are commonly present in yeast and humans. In contrast, Arabidopsis and maize genes accumulate RNA polymerases in proximity of the polyadenylation site, a trend that coincided with longer genes and CpG hypomethylation. Lack of promoter-proximal pausing and a higher correlation of nascent and steady-state transcripts indicate Arabidopsis may regulate transcription predominantly at the level of initiation. Our findings provide insight into plant transcription and eukaryotic gene expression as a whole.},

We have demonstrated that the purine-rich strand of the DNA in this region can form two different intramolecular G-quadruplex structures, only one of which seems to be biologically relevant. This biologically relevant structure is the kinetically favored chair-form G-quadruplex, which is destabilized when mutated with a single G --{\textgreater} A transition, resulting in a 3-fold increase in basal transcriptional activity of the c-MYC promoter. The cationic porphyrin TMPyP4, which has been shown to stabilize this G-quadruplex structure, is able to suppress further c-MYC transcriptional activation. These results provide compelling evidence that a specific G-quadruplex structure formed in the c-MYC promoter region functions as a transcriptional repressor element. Furthermore, we establish the principle that c-MYC transcription can be controlled by ligand-mediated G-quadruplex stabilization.},

The volume and complexity of data from RNA-seq experiments necessitate scalable, fast and mathematically principled analysis software. TopHat and Cufflinks are free, open-source software tools for gene discovery and comprehensive expression analysis of high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Together, they allow biologists to identify new genes and new splice variants of known ones, as well as compare gene and transcript expression under two or more conditions. This protocol describes in detail how to use TopHat and Cufflinks to perform such analyses. It also covers several accessory tools and utilities that aid in managing data, including CummeRbund, a tool for visualizing RNA-seq analysis results. Although the procedure assumes basic informatics skills, these tools assume little to no background with RNA-seq analysis and are meant for novices and experts alike. The protocol begins with raw sequencing reads and produces a transcriptome assembly, lists of differentially expressed and regulated genes and transcripts, and publication-quality visualizations of analysis results. The protocol's execution time depends on the volume of transcriptome sequencing data and available computing resources but takes less than 1 d of computer time for typical experiments and ∼1 h of hands-on time.},

abstract = {The proteins encoded by ATRX and DAXX participate in chromatin remodeling at telomeres and other genomic sites. Because inactivating mutations of these genes are common in human pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs), we examined the telomere status of these tumors. We found that 61{\%} of PanNETs displayed abnormal telomeres that are characteristic of a telomerase-independent telomere maintenance mechanism termed ALT (alternative lengthening of telomeres). All of the PanNETs exhibiting these abnormal telomeres had ATRX or DAXX mutations or loss of nuclear ATRX or DAXX protein. ATRX mutations also correlate with abnormal telomeres in tumors of the central nervous system. These data suggest that an alternative telomere maintenance function may operate in human tumors with alterations in the ATRX or DAXX genes.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90{\%} success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code.

abstract = {Tandem stretches of guanines can associate in hydrogen-bonded arrays to form G-quadruplexes, which are stabilized by K(+) ions. Using computational methods, we searched for G-Quadruplex Sequence (GQS) patterns in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. We found ∼ 1200 GQS with a G(3) repeat sequence motif, most of which are located in the intergenic region. Using a Markov modeled genome, we determined that GQS are significantly underrepresented in the genome. Additionally, we found ∼ 43,000 GQS with a G(2) repeat sequence motif; notably, 80{\%} of these were located in genic regions, suggesting that these sequences may fold at the RNA level. Gene Ontology functional analysis revealed that GQS are overrepresented in genes encoding proteins of certain functional categories, including enzyme activity. Conversely, GQS are underrepresented in other categories of genes, notably those for non-coding RNAs such as tRNAs and rRNAs. We also find that genes that are differentially regulated by drought are significantly more likely to contain a GQS. CD-detected K(+) titrations performed on representative RNAs verified formation of quadruplexes at physiological K(+) concentrations. Overall, this study indicates that GQS are present at unique locations in Arabidopsis and that folding of RNA GQS may play important roles in regulating gene expression.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Most analyses of microarray data are based on point estimates of expression levels and ignore the uncertainty of such estimates. By determining uncertainties from Affymetrix GeneChip data and propagating these uncertainties to downstream analyses it has been shown that we can improve results of differential expression detection, principal component analysis and clustering. Previously, implementations of these uncertainty propagation methods have only been available as separate packages, written in different languages. Previous implementations have also suffered from being very costly to compute, and in the case of differential expression detection, have been limited in the experimental designs to which they can be applied.RESULTS:puma is a Bioconductor package incorporating a suite of analysis methods for use on Affymetrix GeneChip data. puma extends the differential expression detection methods of previous work from the 2-class case to the multi-factorial case. puma can be used to automatically create design and contrast matrices for typical experimental designs, which can be used both within the package itself but also in other Bioconductor packages. The implementation of differential expression detection methods has been parallelised leading to significant decreases in processing time on a range of computer architectures. puma incorporates the first R implementation of an uncertainty propagation version of principal component analysis, and an implementation of a clustering method based on uncertainty propagation. All of these techniques are brought together in a single, easy-to-use package with clear, task-based documentation.CONCLUSION:For the first time, the puma package makes a suite of uncertainty propagation methods available to a general audience. These methods can be used to improve results from more traditional analyses of microarray data. puma also offers improvements in terms of scope and speed of execution over previously available methods. puma is recommended for anyone working with the Affymetrix GeneChip platform for gene expression analysis and can also be applied more generally.},

abstract = {Approximately 45{\%} of sporadic well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors harbor mutations in either ATRX (alpha thalassemia/mental retardation X-linked) or DAXX (death domain-associated protein). These novel tumor suppressor genes encode nuclear proteins that interact with one another and function in chromatin remodeling at telomeric and peri-centromeric regions. Mutations in these genes are associated with loss of their protein expression and correlate with the alternative lengthening of telomeres phenotype. Patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia-1 (MEN-1) syndrome, genetically defined by a germ line mutation in the MEN1 gene, are predisposed to developing pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and thus represent a unique model for studying the timing of ATRX and DAXX inactivation in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor development. We characterized ATRX and DAXX protein expression by immunohistochemistry and telomere status by telomere-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization in 109 well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine lesions from 28 MEN-1 syndrome patients. The study consisted of 47 neuroendocrine microadenomas ({\textless}0.5 cm), 50 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (≥0.5 cm), and 12 pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor lymph node metastases. Expression of ATRX and DAXX was intact in all 47 microadenomas, and none showed the alternative lengthening of telomeres phenotype. ATRX and/or DAXX expression was lost in 3 of 50 (6{\%}) pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. In all three of these, tumor size was ≥3 cm, and loss of ATRX and/or DAXX expression correlated with the alternative lengthening of telomeres phenotype. Concurrent lymph node metastases were present for two of the three tumors, and each metastasis displayed the same changes as the primary tumor. These findings establish the existence of ATRX and DAXX defects and the alternative lengthening of telomeres phenotype in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in the context of MEN-1 syndrome. The observation that ATRX and DAXX defects and the alternative lengthening of telomeres phenotype occurred only in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors measuring ≥3 cm and their lymph node metastases suggests that these changes are late events in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor development.},

abstract = {Although well studied in vitro, the in vivo functions of G-quadruplexes (G4-DNA and G4-RNA) are only beginning to be defined. Recent studies have demonstrated enrichment for sequences with intramolecular G-quadruplex forming potential (QFP) in transcriptional promoters of humans, chickens and bacteria. Here we survey the yeast genome for QFP sequences and similarly find strong enrichment for these sequences in upstream promoter regions, as well as weaker but significant enrichment in open reading frames (ORFs). Further, four findings are consistent with roles for QFP sequences in transcriptional regulation. First, QFP is correlated with upstream promoter regions with low histone occupancy. Second, treatment of cells with N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMM), which binds G-quadruplexes selectively in vitro, causes significant upregulation of loci with QFP-possessing promoters or ORFs. NMM also causes downregulation of loci connected with the function of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA), which itself has high QFP. Third, ORFs with QFP are selectively downregulated in sgs1 mutants that lack the G4-DNA-unwinding helicase Sgs1p. Fourth, a screen for yeast mutants that enhance or suppress growth inhibition by NMM revealed enrichment for chromatin and transcriptional regulators, as well as telomere maintenance factors. These findings raise the possibility that QFP sequences form bona fide G-quadruplexes in vivo and thus regulate transcription.},

abstract = {The flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana is a dicot model organism for research in many aspects of plant biology. A comprehensive annotation of its genome paves the way for understanding the functions and activities of all types of transcripts, including mRNA, the various classes of non-coding RNA, and small RNA. The TAIR10 annotation update had a profound impact on Arabidopsis research but was released more than five years ago. Maintaining the accuracy of the annotation continues to be a prerequisite for future progress. Using an integrative annotation pipeline, we assembled tissue-specific RNA-Seq libraries from 113 datasets and constructed 48,359 transcript models of protein-coding genes in eleven tissues. In addition, we annotated various classes of non-coding RNA including microRNA, long intergenic RNA, small nucleolar RNA, natural antisense transcript, small nuclear RNA, and small RNA using published datasets and in-house analytic results. Altogether, we identified 635 novel protein-coding genes, 508 novel transcribed regions, 5,178 non-coding RNAs, and 35,846 small RNA loci that were formerly unannotated. Analysis of the splicing events and RNA-Seq based expression profiles revealed the landscapes of gene structures, untranslated regions, and splicing activities to be more intricate than previously appreciated. Furthermore, we present 692 uniformly expressed housekeeping genes, 43{\%} of whose human orthologs are also housekeeping genes. This updated Arabidopsis genome annotation with a substantially increased resolution of gene models will not only further our understanding of the biological processes of this plant model but also of other species.

It has been suggested that Pol II stalling is used to produce dynamic and rapid responses of developmental patterning genes to transient cues such as extracellular signaling molecules. Here, we present a combined computational and experimental analysis of stalled promoters to determine how they come to bind Pol II in the early Drosophila embryo. At least one-fourth of the stalled promoters contain a shared sequence motif, the "pause button" (PB): KCGRWCG. The PB motif is sometimes located in the position of the DPE, and over one-fifth of the stalled promoters contain the following arrangement of core elements: GAGA, Inr, PB, and/or DPE. This arrangement was used to identify additional stalled promoters in the Drosophila genome, and permanganate footprint assays were used to confirm that the segmentation gene engrailed contains paused Pol II as seen for heat-shock genes. We discuss different models for Pol II binding and gene activation in the early embryo.},

abstract = {Nucleosomes compact and regulate access to DNA in the nucleus, and are composed of approximately 147 bases of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer. Here we report a genome-wide nucleosome positioning analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana using massively parallel sequencing of mononucleosomes. By combining this data with profiles of DNA methylation at single base resolution, we identified 10-base periodicities in the DNA methylation status of nucleosome-bound DNA and found that nucleosomal DNA was more highly methylated than flanking DNA. These results indicate that nucleosome positioning influences DNA methylation patterning throughout the genome and that DNA methyltransferases preferentially target nucleosome-bound DNA. We also observed similar trends in human nucleosomal DNA, indicating that the relationships between nucleosomes and DNA methyltransferases are conserved. Finally, as has been observed in animals, nucleosomes were highly enriched on exons, and preferentially positioned at intron-exon and exon-intron boundaries. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) was also enriched on exons relative to introns, consistent with the hypothesis that nucleosome positioning regulates Pol II processivity. DNA methylation is also enriched on exons, consistent with the targeting of DNA methylation to nucleosomes, and suggesting a role for DNA methylation in exon definition.},

abstract = {A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of read counts from RNA-Seq gene expression studies. It provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation. Biological variation between RNA samples is estimated separately from the technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline is implemented in the edgeR package of the Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq applications, including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks and DNA methylation analyses.},

abstract = {ATRX (alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked) belongs to the SWI2/SNF2 family of chromatin remodeling proteins. Besides the ATPase/helicase domain at its C terminus, it contains a PHD-like zinc finger at the N terminus. Mutations in the ATRX gene are associated with X-linked mental retardation (XLMR) often accompanied by alpha thalassemia (ATRX syndrome). Although ATRX has been postulated to be a transcriptional regulator, its precise roles remain undefined. We demonstrate ATRX localization at the telomeres in interphase mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells in synchrony with the incorporation of H3.3 during telomere replication at S phase. Moreover, we found that chromobox homolog 5 (CBX5) (also known as heterochromatin protein 1 alpha, or HP1 alpha) is also present at the telomeres in ES cells. We show by coimmunoprecipitation that this localization is dependent on the association of ATRX with histone H3.3, and that mutating the K4 residue of H3.3 significantly diminishes ATRX and H3.3 interaction. RNAi-knockdown of ATRX induces a telomere-dysfunction phenotype and significantly reduces CBX5 enrichment at the telomeres. These findings suggest a novel function of ATRX, working in conjunction with H3.3 and CBX5, as a key regulator of ES-cell telomere chromatin.},

abstract = {G-quadruplex (G4) can be formed by G-rich DNA sequences that are widely distributed throughout the human genome. Although G-triplex and G-hairpin have been proposed as G4 folding intermediates, their formation still requires further investigation by experiments. Here, we employed single-molecule FRET to characterize the folding dynamics of G4 from human telomeric sequence. First, we observed four states during G4 folding initially assigned to be anti-parallel G4, G-triplex, G-hairpin and unfolded ssDNA. Then we constructed putative intra-strand G-triplex, G-hairpin structures and confirmed their existences in both NaCl and KCl. Further studies revealed those structures are going through dynamic transitions between different states and show relatively weak dependence on cations, unlike G4. Based on those results and molecular dynamics simulations, we proposed a multi-pathway folding mechanism for human telomeric G4. The present work may shed new light on our current understanding about the existence and stability of G4 intermediate states.},

abstract = {ME1a1, a 16-base-pair nuclear factor binding site residing between the c-MYC P1 and P2 transcription initiation sites, is required for P2 activity. A cDNA encoding a 477-amino acid zinc finger protein designated MAZ (MYC-associated zinc finger protein) was cloned from a HeLa lambda gt11 library by screening with a concatamerized ME1a1 binding site probe. In addition to six potential zinc fingers of the Cys2His2 type, MAZ contains an amino-terminal proline-rich domain and several polyalanine tracts. Its mRNA was present in all human tissues tested except for kidney, as a doublet of approximately 2.5 and 2.7 kilobases, along with differentially expressed minor species. MAZ bound specifically to the wild-type ME1a1 sequence but not to a ME1a1 mutant that also failed to yield P2 activity. When expressed as a fusion protein in a pMAL-c vector, MAZ binds with specificity to a GA box sequence (GGGAGGG) found in the c-MYC P2 promoter, to the P2 attenuator region within the gene's first exon, and to a related sequence involved in the transcriptional termination of the C2 gene. MAZ may encode a transcription factor with dual roles in transcription initiation and termination.},

Metabolic tagging of newly transcribed RNA by 4-thiouridine (4sU) can reveal the relative contributions of RNA synthesis and decay rates. The kinetics of RNA processing, however, had so far remained unresolved. Here, we show that ultrashort 4sU-tagging not only provides snapshot pictures of eukaryotic gene expression but, when combined with progressive 4sU-tagging and RNA-seq, reveals global RNA processing kinetics at nucleotide resolution. Using this method, we identified classes of rapidly and slowly spliced/degraded introns. Interestingly, each class of splicing kinetics was characterized by a distinct association with intron length, gene length, and splice site strength. For a large group of introns, we also observed long lasting retention in the primary transcript, but efficient secondary splicing or degradation at later time points. Finally, we show that processing of most, but not all small nucleolar (sno)RNA-containing introns is remarkably inefficient with the majority of introns being spliced and degraded rather than processed into mature snoRNAs. In summary, our study yields unparalleled insights into the kinetics of RNA processing and provides the tools to study molecular mechanisms of RNA processing and their contribution to the regulation of gene expression.},

The successful crystallization and structure analysis of a bimolecular human telomeric RNA G-quadruplex, folded into the same crystalline environment as an equivalent DNA oligonucleotide sequence, is reported here. The structural basis of the increased stability of RNA telomeric quadruplexes over DNA ones and their preference for parallel topologies is described here. Our findings suggest that the 2'-OH hydroxyl groups in the RNA quadruplex play a significant role in redefining hydration structure in the grooves and the hydrogen bonding networks. The preference for specific nucleotides to populate the C3'-endo sugar pucker domain is accommodated by alterations in the phosphate backbone, which leads to greater stability through enhanced hydrogen bonding networks. Molecular dynamics simulations on the DNA and RNA quadruplexes are consistent with these findings. The computations, based on the native crystal structure, provide an explanation for RNA G-quadruplex ligand binding selectivity for a group of naphthalene diimide ligands as compared to the DNA G-quadruplex.},

Here, we have shown that the correlations (iii, a and b) for ‘localized genes' and genes from the bank are in full agreement, indicating that the former set is representative of the latter. We haven then used the data (i) and the correlation (ii) to estimate the distribution of genes in isochore families. We have found that 34{\%} of the genes are located in the GC-poor isochores (which represent 62{\%} of the genome), 38{\%} in the GC-rich isochores (31{\%} of the genome) and 28{\%} in the GC-richest isochores (3 {\%} of the genome). There is, therefore, a compositional gradient of gene concentration in the human genome. The gene density in the GC-richest 3{\%} of the genome is about eight times higher than in the GC-rich 31{\%}, and about 16 times higher than in the GC-poorest 62{\%}.},

abstract = {The origin and importance of exon-intron architecture comprises one of the remaining mysteries of gene evolution. Several studies have investigated the variations of intron length, GC content, ordinal position in a gene and divergence. However, there is little study about the structural variation of exons and introns. We investigated the length, GC content, ordinal position and divergence in both exons and introns of 13 eukaryotic genomes, representing plant and animal. Our analyses revealed that three basic patterns of exon-intron variation were present in nearly all analyzed genomes (P {\textless} 0.001 in most cases): an ordinal reduction of length and divergence in both exon and intron, a co-variation between exon and its flanking introns in their length, GC content and divergence, and a decrease of average exon (or intron) length, GC content and divergence as the total exon numbers of a gene increased. In addition, we observed that the shorter introns had either low or high GC content, and the GC content of long introns was intermediate. Although the factors contributing to these patterns have not been identified, our results provide three important clues: common factor(s) exist and may shape both exons and introns; the ordinal reduction patterns may reflect a time-orderly evolution; and the larger first and last exons may be splicing-required. These clues provide a framework for elucidating mechanisms involved in the organization of eukaryotic genomes and particularly in building exon-intron structures.},

The definition of potential G-quadruplex sequences has major repercussions on the observation of the structure since it introduces a bias. The canonical motif only describes a sub-population of the reported G-quadruplexes. To address these issues, we propose an RNA G-quadruplex prediction strategy that does not rely on a motif definition. We trained an artificial neural network with sequences of experimentally validated G-quadruplexes from the G4RNA database encoded using an abstract definition of their sequence. This artificial neural network, G4NN, evaluates the similarity of a given sequence to known G-quadruplexes and reports it as a score. G4NN has a predictive power comparable to the reported G richness and G/C skewness evaluations that are the current state-of-the-art for the identification of potential RNA G-quadruplexes. We combined these approaches in the G4RNA screener, a program designed to manage and evaluate the sequences to identify potential G-quadruplexes.},

abstract = {The third, or wobble, position in a codon provides a high degree of possible degeneracy and is an elegant fault-tolerance mechanism. Nucleotide biases between organisms at the wobble position have been documented and correlated with the abundances of the complementary tRNAs. We and others have noticed a bias for cytosine and guanine at the third position in a subset of transcripts within a single organism. The bias is present in some plant species and warm-blooded vertebrates but not in all plants, or in invertebrates or cold-blooded vertebrates. Here we demonstrate that in certain organisms the amount of GC at the wobble position (GC3) can be used to distinguish two classes of genes. We highlight the following features of genes with high GC3 content: they (1) provide more targets for methylation, (2) exhibit more variable expression, (3) more frequently possess upstream TATA boxes, (4) are predominant in certain classes of genes (e.g., stress responsive genes) and (5) have a GC3 content that increases from 5'to 3'. These observations led us to formulate a hypothesis to explain GC3 bimodality in grasses. Our findings suggest that high levels of GC3 typify a class of genes whose expression is regulated through DNA methylation or are a legacy of accelerated evolution through gene conversion. We discuss the three most probable explanations for GC3 bimodality: biased gene conversion, transcriptional and translational advantage and gene methylation.},

Here we present a high-resolution sequencing-based method to detect G4s in the human genome. We identified 716,310 distinct G4 structures, 451,646 of which were not predicted by computational methods. These included previously uncharacterized noncanonical long loop and bulged structures. We observed a high G4 density in functional regions, such as 5' untranslated regions and splicing sites, as well as in genes previously not predicted to contain these structures (such as BRCA2). G4 formation was significantly associated with oncogenes, tumor suppressors and somatic copy number alterations related to cancer development. The G4s identified in this study may therefore represent promising targets for cancer intervention.},

Our model differentiates many widely accepted putative quadruplex sequences that do not actually form stable genomic G4 structures, correctly assessing the G4 folding potential of over 700,000 such sequences in the human genome. Moreover, our approach reveals the relative importance of sequence-based features coming from both within the G4 motifs and their flanking regions.

Detection of SCEs typically requires cells to incorporate bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) during two rounds of DNA synthesis. Previous studies have suggested that SCEs are induced by DNA replication over BrdU-substituted DNA and that BrdU incorporation alone could be responsible for the high number of SCE events observed in cells from patients with Bloom syndrome (BS), a rare genetic disorder characterized by marked genome instability and high SCE frequency. Here we show using Strand-seq, a single cell DNA template strand sequencing technique, that the presence of variable BrdU concentrations in the cell culture medium and in DNA template strands has no effect on SCE frequency in either normal or BS cells. We conclude that BrdU does not induce SCEs and that SCEs detected in either normal or BS cells reflect DNA repair events that occur spontaneously.},

The identification of G4-forming sequences is important to study the specific structure-function relationships of such regions. In the present study, we developed a method for identification of G4 clusters on genomic DNA by high-throughput sequencing of genomic DNA amplified via whole-genome amplification (WGA) in the presence of a G4 ligand. The G4 ligand specifically bound to G4 structures on genomic DNA; thus, DNA polymerase was arrested on the G4 structures stabilised by G4 ligand. We utilised the telomestatin derivative L1H1-7OTD as a G4 ligand and demonstrated that the efficiency of amplification of the G4 cluster regions was lower than that of the non-G4-forming regions. By high-throughput sequencing of the WGA products, 9,651 G4 clusters were identified on human genomic DNA. Among these clusters, 3,766 G4 clusters contained at least one transcriptional start site, suggesting that genes are regulated by G4 clusters rather than by one G4 structure.},

Here we show, by ChIP-Seq analysis of human cells, that 40{\%} of the binding sites of the transcription-associated helicases, XPB and XPD, overlap with G4 motifs. The highly significant overlap of XPB and XPD binding sites with G4 motifs cannot be explained by GC richness or parameters of the genomewide analysis, but instead suggests that these proteins are recruited to quadruplex structures that form in genomic DNA (G4 DNA). Biochemical analysis demonstrates that XPD is a robust G4 DNA helicase and that XPB binds G4 DNA. XPB and XPD are enriched near the transcription start site at 20{\%} of genes, especially highly transcribed genes. XPB and XPD enrichment at G4 motifs characterizes specific signaling pathways and regulatory pathways associated with specific cancers. These results identify new candidate pathways for therapies targeted to quadruplexes.},

abstract = {Summary Protein-coding genes in eukaryotes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and introns are removed from pre-mRNA by the spliceosome. Understanding the time lag between Pol II progression and splicing could provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of gene expression. Here, we present two single-molecule nascent RNA sequencing methods that directly determine the progress of splicing catalysis as a function of Pol II position. Endogenous genes were analyzed on a global scale in budding yeast. We show that splicing is 50{\%} complete when Pol II is only 45 nt downstream of introns, with the first spliced products observed as introns emerge from Pol II. Perturbations that slow the rate of spliceosome assembly or speed up the rate of transcription caused splicing delays, showing that regulation of both processes determines in vivo splicing profiles. We propose that matched rates streamline the gene expression pathway, while allowing regulation through kinetic competition.},

abstract = {Pre-mRNA splicing is regulated through the combinatorial activity of RNA motifs, including splice sites and splicing regulatory elements. Here we show that the activity of the G-run (polyguanine sequence) class of splicing enhancer elements is approximately 4-fold higher when adjacent to intermediate strength 5' splice sites (ss) than when adjacent to weak 5' ss, and approximately 1.3-fold higher relative to strong 5' ss. We observed this dependence on 5' ss strength in both splicing reporters and in global microarray and mRNA-Seq analyses of splicing changes following RNA interference against heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) H, which cross-linked to G-runs adjacent to many regulated exons. An exon's responsiveness to changes in hnRNP H levels therefore depends in a complex way on G-run abundance and 5' ss strength. This pattern of activity enables G-runs and hnRNP H to buffer the effects of 5' ss mutations, augmenting both the frequency of 5' ss polymorphism and the evolution of new splicing patterns. Certain other splicing factors may function similarly.},

abstract = {Plants are used as representative reference biota for the biological assessment of environmental risks such as ionizing radiation due to their immobility. This study proposed a faster, more economical, and more effective method than conventional cytogenetic methods for the biological dosimetry of ionizing radiation in plants (phytodosimetry). We compared various dose-response curves for the radiation-induced DNA damage response (DDR) in Arabidopsis thaliana after relatively “low-dose” gamma irradiation (3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 Gy) below tens of Gy using comet (or single-cell gel electrophoresis), gamma-H2AX, and transcriptomic assays of seven DDR genes (AGO2, BRCA1, GRG, PARP1, RAD17, RAD51, and RPA1E) using quantitative real time PCR. The DDR signal from the comet assay was saturated at 6 Gy, while the gamma-H2AX signal increased up to 48 Gy, following a linear-quadratic dose-response model. The transcriptional changes in the seven DDR genes were fitted to linear or supra-linear quadratic equations with significant dose-dependency. The dose-dependent transcriptional changes were maintained similarly until 24 h after irradiation. The integrated transcriptional dose-response model of AGO2, BRCA1, GRG, and PARP1 was very similar to that of gamma-H2AX, while the transcriptional changes in the BRCA1, GRG, and PARP1 DDR genes revealed significant dependency on the dose-rate, ecotype, and radiation dose. These results suggest that the transcriptome-based dose-response model fitted to a quadratic equation could be used practically for phytodosimetry instead of conventional cytogenetic models, such as the comet and gamma-H2AX assays. The effects of dose-rate and ecotype on the transcriptional changes of DDR genes should also be considered to improve the transcriptome-based phytodosimetry model.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing of precursor mRNA is an essential mechanism to increase the complexity of gene expression, and it plays an important role in cellular differentiation and organism development. Regulation of alternative splicing is a complicated process in which numerous interacting components are at work, including cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors, and is further guided by the functional coupling between transcription and splicing. Additional molecular features, such as chromatin structure, RNA structure and alternative transcription initiation or alternative transcription termination, collaborate with these basic components to generate the protein diversity due to alternative splicing. All these factors contributing to this one fundamental biological process add up to a mechanism that is critical to the proper functioning of cells. Any corruption of the process may lead to disruption of normal cellular function and the eventuality of disease. Cancer is one of those diseases, where alternative splicing may be the basis for the identification of novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as new strategies for therapy. Thus, an in-depth understanding of alternative splicing regulation has the potential not only to elucidate fundamental biological principles, but to provide solutions for various diseases.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing increases transcriptome and proteome diversification. Previous analyses aiming at comparing the rate of alternative splicing between different organisms provided contradicting results. These contradicting results were attributed to the fact that both analyses were dependent on the expressed sequence tag (EST) coverage, which varies greatly between the tested organisms. In this study we compare the level of alternative splicing among eight different organisms. By employing an EST independent approach we reveal that the percentage of genes and exons undergoing alternative splicing is higher in vertebrates compared with invertebrates. We also find that alternative exons of the skipping type are flanked by longer introns compared to constitutive ones, whereas alternative 5' and 3' splice sites events are generally not. In addition, although the regulation of alternative splicing and sizes of introns and exons have changed during metazoan evolution, intron retention remained the rarest type of alternative splicing, whereas exon skipping is more prevalent and exhibits a slight increase, from invertebrates to vertebrates. The difference in the level of alternative splicing suggests that alternative splicing may contribute greatly to the mammal higher level of phenotypic complexity, and that accumulation of introns confers an evolutionary advantage as it allows increasing the number of alternative splicing forms.},

abstract = {RNA structures in the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs influence post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Much of the knowledge in this area depends on canonical double-stranded RNA elements. There has been considerable recent advancement of our understanding of guanine(G)-rich nucleic acids sequences that form four-stranded structures, called G-quadruplexes. While much of the research has been focused on DNA G-quadruplexes, there has recently been a rapid emergence of interest in RNA G-quadruplexes, particularly in the 5'-UTRs of mRNAs. Collectively, these studies suggest that RNA G-quadruplexes exist in the 5'-UTRs of many genes, including genes of clinical interest, and that such structural elements can influence translation. This review features the progresses in the study of 5'-UTR RNA G-quadruplex-mediated translational control. It covers computational analysis, cell-free, cell-based and chemical biology studies that have sought to elucidate the roles of RNA G-quadruplexes in both cap-dependent and -independent regulation of mRNA translation. We also discuss protein trans-acting factors that have been implicated and the evidence that such RNA motifs have potential as small molecule target. Finally, we close the review with a perspective on the future challenges in the field of 5'-UTR RNA G-quadruplex-mediated translation regulation.},

We have determined the solution structures of the three quasi-RNA-recognition motifs (qRRMs) of hnRNP F in complex with G-tract RNA. These structures show that qRRMs bind RNA in a very unusual manner, with the G-tract 'encaged', making the qRRM a novel RNA binding domain. We defined a consensus signature sequence for qRRMs and identified other human qRRM-containing proteins that also specifically recognize G-tract RNAs. Our structures explain how qRRMs can sequester G-tracts, maintaining them in a single-stranded conformation. We also show that isolated qRRMs of hnRNP F are sufficient to regulate the alternative splicing of the Bcl-x pre-mRNA, suggesting that hnRNP F would act by remodeling RNA secondary and tertiary structures.},

@article{Liu2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microarrays have been a popular tool for gene expression profiling at genome-scale for over a decade due to the low cost, short turn-around time, excellent quantitative accuracy and ease of data generation. The Bioconductor package puma incorporates a suite of analysis methods for determining uncertainties from Affymetrix GeneChip data and propagating these uncertainties to downstream analysis. As isoform level expression profiling receives more and more interest within genomics in recent years, exon microarray technology offers an important tool to quantify expression level of the majority of exons and enables the possibility of measuring isoform level expression. However, puma does not include methods for the analysis of exon array data. Moreover, the current expression summarisation method for Affymetrix 3' GeneChip data suffers from instability for low expression genes. For the downstream analysis, the method for differential expression detection is computationally intensive and the original expression clustering method does not consider the variance across the replicated technical and biological measurements. It is therefore necessary to develop improved uncertainty propagation methods for gene and transcript expression analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We extend the previously developed Bioconductor package puma with a new method especially designed for GeneChip Exon arrays and a set of improved downstream approaches. The improvements include: (i) a new gamma model for exon arrays which calculates isoform and gene expression measurements and a level of uncertainty associated with the estimates, using the multi-mappings between probes, isoforms and genes, (ii) a variant of the existing approach for the probe-level analysis of Affymetrix 3' GeneChip data to produce more stable gene expression estimates, (iii) an improved method for detecting differential expression which is computationally more efficient than the existing approach in the package and (iv) an improved method for robust model-based clustering of gene expression, which takes technical and biological replicate information into consideration.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: With the extensions and improvements, the puma package is now applicable to the analysis of both Affymetrix 3' GeneChips and Exon arrays for gene and isoform expression estimation. It propagates the uncertainty of expression measurements into more efficient and comprehensive downstream analysis at both gene and isoform level. Downstream methods are also applicable to other expression quantification platforms, such as RNA-Seq, when uncertainty information is available from expression measurements. puma is available through Bioconductor and can be found at http://www.bioconductor.org.},

abstract = {Transcriptional pausing by RNA polymerase is an underlying event in the regulation of transcript elongation, yet the physical changes in the transcribing complex that create the initially paused conformation remain poorly understood. We report that this nonbacktracked elemental pause results from an active-site rearrangement whose signature includes a trigger-loop conformation positioned near the RNA 3′ nucleotide and a conformation of $\beta$DloopII that allows fraying of the RNA 3′ nucleotide away from the DNA template. During nucleotide addition, trigger-loop movements or folding appears to assist NTP-stimulated translocation and to be crucial for catalysis. At a pause, the trigger loop directly contributes to the paused conformation, apparently by restriction of its movement or folding, whereas a previously postulated unfolding of the bridge helix does not. This trigger-loop-centric model can explain many properties of transcriptional pausing. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The human bcl-2 gene contains a GC-rich region upstream of the P1 promoter that has been shown to be critically involved in the regulation of bcl-2 gene expression. We have demonstrated that the guanine-rich strand of the DNA in this region can form any one of three distinct intramolecular G-quadruplex structures. Mutation and deletion analysis permitted isolation and identification of three overlapping DNA sequences within this element that formed the three individual G-quadruplexes. Each of these was characterized using nondenaturing gel analysis, DMS footprinting, and circular dichroism. The central G-quadruplex, which is the most stable, forms a mixed parallel/antiparallel structure consisting of three tetrads connected by loops of one, seven, and three bases. Three different G-quadruplex-interactive agents were found to further stabilize these structures, with individual selectivity toward one or more of these G-quadruplexes. Collectively, these results suggest that the multiple G-quadruplexes identified in the promoter region of the bcl-2 gene are likely to play a similar role to the G-quadruplexes in the c-myc promoter in that their formation could serve to modulate gene transcription. Last, we demonstrate that the complexity of the G-quadruplexes in the bcl-2 promoter extends beyond the ability to form any one of three separate G-quadruplexes to each having the capacity to form either three or six different loop isomers. These results are discussed in relation to the biological significance of this G-quadruplex-forming element in modulation of bcl-2 gene expression and the inherent complexity of the system where different G-quadruplexes and loop isomers are possible.},

Exosome‐mediated degradation of these RNAs requires its cofactor hMTR4. Significantly, hMTR4 plays a key role in specifically recruiting the exosome to its targets. Furthermore, we provide several lines of evidence indicating that hMTR4 executes this role by directly competing with the mRNA export adaptor ALYREF for associating with ARS2, a component of the cap‐binding complex (CBC), and this competition is critical for determining whether an RNA is degraded or exported to the cytoplasm. Together, our results indicate that the competition between hMTR4 and ALYREF determines exosome recruitment and functions in creating balanced nuclear RNA pools for degradation and export.The EMBO Journal (2017) 36: 2870–2886},

abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) is a key regulatory mechanism that contributes to transcriptome and proteome diversity. As very few genome-wide studies analyzing AS in plants are available, we have performed high-throughput sequencing of a normalized cDNA library which resulted in a high coverage transcriptome map of Arabidopsis. We detect ∼150,000 splice junctions derived mostly from typical plant introns, including an eightfold increase in the number of U12 introns (2069). Around 61{\%} of multiexonic genes are alternatively spliced under normal growth conditions. Moreover, we provide experimental validation of 540 AS transcripts (from 256 genes coding for important regulatory factors) using high-resolution RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Intron retention (IR) is the most frequent AS event (∼40{\%}), but many IRs have relatively low read coverage and are less well-represented in assembled transcripts. Additionally, ∼51{\%} of Arabidopsis genes produce AS transcripts which do not involve IR. Therefore, the significance of IR in generating transcript diversity was generally overestimated in previous assessments. IR analysis allowed the identification of a large set of cryptic introns inside annotated coding exons. Importantly, a significant fraction of these cryptic introns are spliced out in frame, indicating a role in protein diversity. Furthermore, we show extensive AS coupled to nonsense-mediated decay in AFC2, encoding a highly conserved LAMMER kinase which phosphorylates splicing factors, thus establishing a complex loop in AS regulation. We provide the most comprehensive analysis of AS to date which will serve as a valuable resource for the plant community to study transcriptome complexity and gene regulation.},

These factors couple the machineries that function in splicing and export of mRNA. Here we show that both Yra1 and Sub2 are stoichiometrically associated with the heterotetrameric THO complex, which functions in transcription in yeast. We also show that Sub2 and Yra1 interact genetically with all four components of the THO complex (Tho2, Hpr1, Mft1 and Thp2). Moreover, these components operate in the export of bulk poly(A)(+) RNA as well as of mRNA derived from intronless genes. Both Aly and UAP56 associate with human counterparts of the THO complex. Together, these data define a conserved complex, designated the TREX ('transcription/export') complex. The TREX complex is specifically recruited to activated genes during transcription and travels the entire length of the gene with RNA polymerase II. Our data indicate that the TREX complex has a conserved role in coupling transcription to mRNA export.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) diversifies transcriptomes and proteomes and is widely recognized as a key mechanism for regulating gene expression. Previously, in an analysis of intron retention events in Arabidopsis, we found unusual AS events inside annotated protein-coding exons. Here, we also identify such AS events in human and use these two sets to analyse their features, regulation, functional impact, and evolutionary origin. As these events involve introns with features of both introns and protein-coding exons, we name them exitrons (exonic introns). Though exitrons were detected as a subset of retained introns, they are clearly distinguishable, and their splicing results in transcripts with different fates. About half of the 1002 Arabidopsis and 923 human exitrons have sizes of multiples of 3 nucleotides (nt). Splicing of these exitrons results in internally deleted proteins and affects protein domains, disordered regions, and various post-translational modification sites, thus broadly impacting protein function. Exitron splicing is regulated across tissues, in response to stress and in carcinogenesis. Intriguingly, annotated intronless genes can be also alternatively spliced via exitron usage. We demonstrate that at least some exitrons originate from ancestral coding exons. Based on our findings, we propose a "splicing memory" hypothesis whereby upon intron loss imprints of former exon borders defined by vestigial splicing regulatory elements could drive the evolution of exitron splicing. Altogether, our studies show that exitron splicing is a conserved strategy for increasing proteome plasticity in plants and animals, complementing the repertoire of AS events.},

abstract = {In human and mouse, the promoter of the KRAS gene contains a nuclease hypersensitive polypurine-polypyrimidine element (NHPPE) that is essential for transcription. An interesting feature of the polypurine G-rich strand of NHPPE is its ability to assume an unusual DNA structure that, according to circular dichroism (CD) and DMS footprinting experiments, is attributed to an intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex, consisting of three G-tetrads and three loops. The human and mouse KRAS NHPPE G-rich strands display melting temperature of 64 and 73 degrees C, respectively, as well as a K+-dependent capacity to arrest DNA polymerase. Photocleavage and CD experiments showed that the cationic porphyrin TMPyP4 stacks to the external G-tetrads of the KRAS quadruplexes, increasing the T(m) by approximately 20 degrees C. These findings raise the intriguing question that the G-quadruplex formed within the NHPPE of KRAS may be involved in the regulation of transcription. Indeed, transfection experiments showed that the activity of the mouse KRAS promoter is reduced to 20{\%} of control, in the presence of the quadruplex-stabilizing TMPyP4. In addition, we found that G-rich oligonucleotides mimicking the KRAS quadruplex, but not the corresponding 4-base mutant sequences or oligonucleotides forming quadruplexes with different structures, competed with the NHPPE duplex for binding to nuclear proteins. When vector pKRS-413, containing CAT driven by the mouse KRAS promoter, and KRAS quadruplex oligonucleotides were co-transfected in 293 cells, the expression of CAT was found to be downregulated to 40{\%} of the control. On the basis of these data, we propose that the NHPPE of KRAS exists in equilibrium between a double-stranded form favouring transcription and a folded quadruplex form, which instead inhibits transcription. Such a mechanism, which is probably adopted by other growth-related genes, provides useful hints for the rational design of anticancer drugs against the KRAS oncogene.},

abstract = {Read alignment is an ongoing challenge for the analysis of data from sequencing technologies. This article proposes an elegantly simple multi-seed strategy, called seed-and-vote, for mapping reads to a reference genome. The new strategy chooses the mapped genomic location for the read directly from the seeds. It uses a relatively large number of short seeds (called subreads) extracted from each read and allows all the seeds to vote on the optimal location. When the read length is {\textless}160 bp, overlapping subreads are used. More conventional alignment algorithms are then used to fill in detailed mismatch and indel information between the subreads that make up the winning voting block. The strategy is fast because the overall genomic location has already been chosen before the detailed alignment is done. It is sensitive because no individual subread is required to map exactly, nor are individual subreads constrained to map close by other subreads. It is accurate because the final location must be supported by several different subreads. The strategy extends easily to find exon junctions, by locating reads that contain sets of subreads mapping to different exons of the same gene. It scales up efficiently for longer reads.},

abstract = {ATRX is an X-linked gene of the SWI/SNF family, mutations in which cause syndromal mental retardation and downregulation of $\alpha$-globin expression. Here we show that ATRX binds to tandem repeat (TR) sequences in both telomeres and euchromatin. Genes associated with these TRs can be dysregulated when ATRX is mutated, and the change in expression is determined by the size of the TR, producing skewed allelic expression. This reveals the characteristics of the affected genes, explains the variable phenotypes seen with identical ATRX mutations, and illustrates a new mechanism underlying variable penetrance. Many of the TRs are G rich and predicted to form non-B DNA structures (including G-quadruplex) in vivo. We show that ATRX binds G-quadruplex structures in vitro, suggesting a mechanism by which ATRX may play a role in various nuclear processes and how this is perturbed when ATRX is mutated.

Knowing the mappability of a genome is crucial for the interpretation of massively parallel sequencing experiments. We investigate the properties of the mappability of eukaryotic DNA/RNA both as a whole and at the level of the gene family, providing for various organisms tracks which allow the mappability information to be visually explored. In addition, we show that mappability varies greatly between species and gene classes. Finally, we suggest several practical applications where mappability can be used to refine the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data (SNP calling, gene expression quantification and paired-end experiments). This work highlights mappability as an important concept which deserves to be taken into full account, in particular when massively parallel sequencing technologies are employed.

Mutations in the hATRX gene cause severe syndromal mental retardation associated with -thalassemia. Using indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy we have shown that ATRX protein is associated with pericentromeric heterochromatin during interphase and mitosis. By coimmunofluorescence, ATRX localizes with a mouse homologue of the Drosophila heterochromatic protein HP1 in vivo, consistent with a previous two-hybrid screen identifying this interaction. From the analysis of a trap assay for nuclear proteins, we have shown that the localization of ATRX to heterochromatin is encoded by its N-terminal region, which contains a conserved plant homeodomain-like finger and a coiled-coil domain. In addition to its association with heterochromatin, at metaphase ATRX clearly binds to the short arms of human acrocentric chromosomes, where the arrays of ribosomal DNA are located. The unexpected association of a putative transcriptional regulator with highly repetitive DNA provides a potential explanation for the variability in phenotype of patients with identical mutations in the ATRX gene.},

abstract = {Splicing remains an incompletely understood process. Recent findings suggest that chromatin structure participates in its regulation. Here, we analyze the RNA from subcellular fractions obtained through RNA-seq in the cell line K562. We show that in the human genome, splicing occurs predominantly during transcription. We introduce the coSI measure, based on RNA-seq reads mapping to exon junctions and borders, to assess the degree of splicing completion around internal exons. We show that, as expected, splicing is almost fully completed in cytosolic polyA+ RNA. In chromatin-associated RNA (which includes the RNA that is being transcribed), for 5.6{\%} of exons, the removal of the surrounding introns is fully completed, compared with 0.3{\%} of exons for which no intron-removal has occurred. The remaining exons exist as a mixture of spliced and fewer unspliced molecules, with a median coSI of 0.75. Thus, most RNAs undergo splicing while being transcribed: "co-transcriptional splicing." Consistent with co-transcriptional spliceosome assembly and splicing, we have found significant enrichment of spliceosomal snRNAs in chromatin-associated RNA compared with other cellular RNA fractions and other nonspliceosomal snRNAs. CoSI scores decrease along the gene, pointing to a "first transcribed, first spliced" rule, yet more downstream exons carry other characteristics, favoring rapid, co-transcriptional intron removal. Exons with low coSI values, that is, in the process of being spliced, are enriched with chromatin marks, consistent with a role for chromatin in splicing during transcription. For alternative exons and long noncoding RNAs, splicing tends to occur later, and the latter might remain unspliced in some cases.},

This superfamily consists of three members: hyperglycosylated arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), moderately glycosylated extensins (EXTs), and lightly glycosylated proline-rich proteins (PRPs). Hybrid and chimeric versions of HRGP molecules also exist. In order to "mine" genomic databases for HRGPs and to facilitate and guide research in the field, the BIO OHIO software program was developed that identifies and classifies AGPs, EXTs, PRPs, hybrid HRGPs, and chimeric HRGPs from proteins predicted from DNA sequence data. This bioinformatics program is based on searching for biased amino acid compositions and for particular protein motifs associated with known HRGPs. HRGPs identified by the program are subsequently analyzed to elucidate the following: (1) repeating amino acid sequences, (2) signal peptide and glycosylphosphatidylinositol lipid anchor addition sequences, (3) similar HRGPs via Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, (4) expression patterns of their genes, (5) other HRGPs, glycosyl transferase, prolyl 4-hydroxylase, and peroxidase genes coexpressed with their genes, and (6) gene structure and whether genetic mutants exist in their genes. The program was used to identify and classify 166 HRGPs from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) as follows: 85 AGPs (including classical AGPs, lysine-rich AGPs, arabinogalactan peptides, fasciclin-like AGPs, plastocyanin AGPs, and other chimeric AGPs), 59 EXTs (including SP(5) EXTs, SP(5)/SP(4) EXTs, SP(4) EXTs, SP(4)/SP(3) EXTs, a SP(3) EXT, "short" EXTs, leucine-rich repeat-EXTs, proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinases, and other chimeric EXTs), 18 PRPs (including PRPs and chimeric PRPs), and AGP/EXT hybrid HRGPs.},

@article{Sundquist1989,
abstract = {The telomeric ends of eukaryotic chromosomes are composed of simple repeating sequences in which one DNA strand contains short tracts of guanine residues alternating with short tracts of A/T-rich sequences. The guanine-rich strand is always oriented in a 5'-3' direction towards the end of the chromosome and is extended to produce a 3' overhang of about two repeating units in species where the telomeric terminus is known. This overhang has been implicated in the formation of several unusual intra-and intermolecular DNA structures, although none of these structures has been characterized fully. We now report that oligonucleotides encoding Tetrahymena telomeres dimerize to form stable complexes in solution. This salt-dependent dimerization is mediated entirely by the 3'-terminal telomeric overhang (TT-GGGGTTGGGG) and produces complexes in which the N7 position of every guanine in the overhangs is chemically inaccessible. We therefore propose that telomeric DNA dimerizes by hydrogen bonding between two intramolecular hairpin loops, to form antiparallel quadruplexes containing cyclic guanine base tetrads. These novel hairpin dimers may be important in telomere association and recombination and could also provide a general mechanism for pairing two double helices in other recombinational processes.},

We have also observed that concentrated solutions (25.0 mg/ml) of guanylic acid (GMP) at pH 5 are extremely viscous and, if cooled, form a clear gel. Less con-centrated solutions also gel on cooling but assume a more normal viscosity at room temperature. From examination of the optical properties of the gel and in-vestigation of the structure of fibers obtained from the gel by drying, we have con-cluded that, at least in the case of the 5' isomer, the phenomenon may be explained as being due to helix formation by the guanylic acid. A possible structure is pre-sented for this helix. Materials and Methods.-Ultraviolet absorption was measured with a Cary Model 15 spectro-photometer, using an 0.1 mm cell. A water-jacketed cell housing was used to maintain tempera-ture. To measure optical densities greater than 2.0, calibrated neutral density screens were placed in the reference beam. In this way, optical densities up to at least 3.5 could be accurately meas-ured, the instrumental stray light level being sufficiently low. Optical rotation measurements were performed on a Rudolph Model 80 spectropolarimeter, using a water-jacketed 1-cm cell. Specific rotations are uncertain by 4 100. Fibers were obtained from concentrated solutions at pH 5 by suspending a drop of the material over the ends of a U-shaped piece of paper clip and allowing it to dry slowly at 40C. The material dried into highly negatively birefringent fibers 5 mm long by 0.1 to 0.3 mm wide. X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded in a modified Philips fiber camera at several different relative humidities. The materials examined were obtained from the following sources: 5' GMP, Pabst and Schwarz: guanosine, Schwarz; mixed 2'-, 3 '-GMP, disodium salt, Sigma. Since the chromatographic separation of 2'-and 3'-GMP was found to require different conditions from those previously described for hydrolysates of crude RNA,' the separation is described.

The local features of genomic structure that contribute to pausing have not been defined. Here, we show that genes that pause are more G-rich within the region flanking the transcription start site (TSS) than RefSeq genes or non-paused genes. We show that enrichment of binding motifs for common transcription factors, such as SP1, may account for G-richness upstream but not downstream of the TSS. We further show that pausing correlates with the presence of a GrIn1 element, an element bearing one or more G4 motifs at the 5'-end of the first intron, on the non-template DNA strand. These results suggest potential roles for dynamic G4 DNA and G4 RNA structures in cis-regulation of pausing, and thus genome-wide regulation of gene expression, in human cells.},

One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An over-dispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of over-dispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

Thus, it is not surprising that upon of deregulation of those molecular machines healthy cells can turn into cancerous cells. Even though the remodeling enzymes are very abundant and a multitude of different enzymes and chromatin remodeling complexes exist in the cell, the particular remodeling complex with its specific nucleosome positioning features must be at the right place at the right time in order to ensure the proper regulation of the DNA dependent processes. To achieve this, chromatin remodeling complexes harbor protein domains that specifically read chromatin targeting signals, such as histone modifications, DNA sequence/structure, non-coding RNAs, histone variants or DNA bound interacting proteins. Recent studies reveal the interaction between non-coding RNAs and chromatin remodeling complexes showing importance of RNA in remodeling enzyme targeting, scaffolding and regulation. In this review, we summarize current understanding of chromatin remodeling enzyme targeting to chromatin and their role in cancer development.},

For example, eIF4A promotes T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia development in vivo and is required for leukaemia maintenance. Accordingly, inhibition of eIF4A with silvestrol has powerful therapeutic effects against murine and human leukaemic cells in vitro and in vivo. We use transcriptome-scale ribosome footprinting to identify the hallmarks of eIF4A-dependent transcripts. These include 5' untranslated region (UTR) sequences such as the 12-nucleotide guanine quartet (CGG)4 motif that can form RNA G-quadruplex structures. Notably, among the most eIF4A-dependent and silvestrol-sensitive transcripts are a number of oncogenes, superenhancer-associated transcription factors, and epigenetic regulators. Hence, the 5' UTRs of select cancer genes harbour a targetable requirement for the eIF4A RNA helicase.},

abstract = {In 1981 three northern European families were described in which a severely mentally retarded son also had haemoglobin H (Hb H) disease.' These findings were of interest because Hb H disease, a relatively severe manifestation of a thalassaemia, is rare in northern Europeans although it is frequently seen in Mediterranean and Oriental racial groups in which it is not known to be associated with an increased frequency of mental retardation. Further-more, whereas the common forms of Hb H disease are always inherited in a mendelian fashion, in these northern European families this appeared not to be so. Hb H disease occurs when a greater than 50{\%} reduction in synthesis of the a globin chains of adult haemoglobin (Hb A, a212) results in the accumula-tion of excess 1 globin chains which form 14 tetramers (Hb H). The common mendelian forms of Hb H disease result from mutations of both allelic a globin complexes, most commonly owing to dele-tions or less frequently to small rearrangements or point mutations. The a globin complex is located close to the telomere of the short arm of chromo-some 16, within band 16pl3.3. By 1990, a total of 13 subjects with a thalassaemia and mental retardation (ATR) had been identified and two distinct syndromes were delineated.34 Eight patients had large (1 to 2 megabases) deletions of the tip of chromosome 16p; the clinical features of this so called ATR-16 syndrome were rather variable, in},

abstract = {Mutations in XPB, an essential subunit of the transcription/repair factor TFIIH, lead to nucleotide excision repair (NER) defects and xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). The role of XPB in NER and the molecular mechanisms resulting in XP are poorly understood. Here, we show that the p52 subunit of TFIIH interacts with XPB and stimulates its ATPase activity. A mutation found among XP-B patients (F99S) weakens this interaction and the resulting ATPase stimulation, thereby explaining the defect in the damaged DNA opening. We next found that mutations in the helicase motifs III (T469A) and VI (Q638A) that inhibit XPB helicase activity preserve the NER function of TFIIH. Our results suggest a mechanism in which the helicase activity of XPB is not used for the opening and repair of damaged DNA, which is instead only driven by its ATPase activity, in combination with the helicase activity of XPD. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In eukaryotes, the translation initiation codon is generally identified by the scanning mechanism, wherein every triplet in the messenger RNA leader is inspected for complementarity to the anticodon of methionyl initiator transfer RNA (Met-tRNAi). Binding of Met-tRNAi to the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, in a ternary complex (TC) with eIF2-GTP, is stimulated by eukaryotic initiation factor 1 (eIF1), eIF1A, eIF3, and eIF5, and the resulting preinitiation complex (PIC) joins the 5' end of mRNA preactivated by eIF4F and poly(A)-binding protein. RNA helicases remove secondary structures that impede ribosome attachment and subsequent scanning. Hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP is stimulated by eIF5 in the scanning PIC, but completion of the reaction is impeded at non-AUG triplets. Although eIF1 and eIF1A promote scanning, eIF1 and possibly the C-terminal tail of eIF1A must be displaced from the P decoding site to permit base-pairing between Met-tRNAi and the AUG codon, as well as to allow subsequent phosphate release from eIF2-GDP. A second GTPase, eIF5B, catalyzes the joining of the 60S subunit to produce an 80S initiation complex that is competent for elongation.},

abstract = {The extent to which alternative splicing and long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) contribute to the specialized functions of cells within an organ is poorly understood. We generated a comprehensive dataset of gene expression from individual cell types of the Arabidopsis root. Comparisons across cell types revealed that alternative splicing tends to remove parts of coding regions from a longer, major isoform, providing evidence for a progressive mechanism of splicing. Cell-type-specific intron retention suggested a possible origin for this common form of alternative splicing. Coordinated alternative splicing across developmental stages pointed to a role in regulating differentiation. Consistent with this hypothesis, distinct isoforms of a transcription factor were shown to control developmental transitions. lincRNAs were generally lowly expressed at the level of individual cell types, but co-expression clusters provided clues as to their function. Our results highlight insights gained from analysis of expression at the level of individual cell types.},

abstract = {Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) are random oligonucleotide barcodes that are increasingly used in high-throughout sequencing experiments. Through a UMI, identical copies arising from distinct molecules can be distinguished from those arising through PCR amplification of the same molecule. However, bioinformatic methods to leverage the information from UMIs have yet to be formalised. In particular, sequencing errors in the UMI sequence are often ignored, or else resolved in an ad-hoc manner. We show that errors in the UMI sequence are common and introduce network based methods to account for these errors when identifying PCR duplicates. Using these methods, we demonstrate improved quantification accuracy both under simulated conditions and real iCLIP and single cell RNA-Seq datasets. Reproducibility between iCLIP replicates and single cell RNA Seq clustering are both improved using our proposed network-based method, demonstrating the value of properly accounting for errors in UMIs. These methods are implemented in the open source UMI-tools software package (https://github.com/CGATOxford/UMI-tools).},

abstract = {G-quadruplex or G4 DNA, a four-stranded DNA structure formed in G-rich sequences, has been hypothesized to be a structural motif involved in gene regulation. In this study, we examined the regulatory role of potential G4 DNA motifs (PG4Ms) located in the putative transcriptional regulatory region (TRR, -500 to +500) of genes across the human genome. We found that PG4Ms in the 500-bp region downstream of the annotated transcription start site (TSS; PG4M(D500)) are associated with gene expression. Generally, PG4M(D500)-positive genes are expressed at higher levels than PG4M(D500)-negative genes, and an increased number of PG4M(D500) provides a cumulative effect. This observation was validated by controlling for attributes, including gene family, function, and promoter similarity. We also observed an asymmetric pattern of PG4M(D500) distribution between strands, whereby the frequency of PG4M(D500) in the coding strand is generally higher than that in the template strand. Further analysis showed that the presence of PG4M(D500) and its strand asymmetry are associated with significant enrichment of RNAP II at the putative TRR. On the basis of these results, we propose a model of G4 DNA-mediated stimulation of transcription with the hypothesis that PG4M(D500) contributes to gene transcription by maintaining the DNA in an open conformation, while the asymmetric distribution of PG4M(D500) considerably reduces the probability of blocking the progression of the RNA polymerase complex on the template strand. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of the regulatory function of G4 DNA in gene transcription.},

The uShuffle tool implements the latest variant of the Euler algorithm and uses Wilson's algorithm in the crucial step of arborescence generation. It is carefully engineered and extremely efficient. The uShuffle tool achieves maximum flexibility by allowing arbitrary alphabet size and let size. It can be used as a command-line program, a web application, or a utility library. Source code in C, Java, and C{\#}, and integration instructions for Perl and Python are provided. The uShuffle tool surpasses existing implementation of the Euler algorithm in both performance and flexibility. It is a useful tool for the bioinformatics community.},

abstract = {The translation initiation step in eukaryotes is highly regulated and rate-limiting. During this process, the 40S ribosomal subunit is usually recruited to the 5' terminus of the mRNA. It then migrates towards the initiation codon, where it is joined by the 60S ribosomal subunit to form the 80S initiation complex. Secondary structures in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) can impede binding and movement of the 40S ribosome. The canonical eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4A (also known as DDX2), together with its accessory proteins eIF4B and eIF4H, is thought to act as a helicase that unwinds secondary structures in the mRNA 5' UTR. Growing evidence suggests that other helicases are also important for translation initiation and may promote the scanning processivity of the 40S subunit, synergize with eIF4A to 'melt' secondary structures or facilitate translation of a subset of mRNAs.},

abstract = {Spliceosome assembly and/or splicing of a nascent transcript may be crucial for proper isoform expression and gene regulation in higher eukaryotes. We recently showed that cotranscriptional splicing occurs efficiently in Drosophila, but there are not comparable genome-wide nascent splicing data from mammals. To provide this comparison, we analyze a recently generated, high-throughput sequencing data set of mouse liver nascent RNA, originally studied for circadian transcriptional regulation. Cotranscriptional splicing is approximately twofold less efficient in mouse liver than in Drosophila, i.e., nascent intron levels relative to exon levels are ∼0.55 in mouse versus 0.25 in the fly. An additional difference between species is that only mouse cotranscriptional splicing is optimal when 5'-exon length is between 50 and 500 bp, and intron length does not correlate with splicing efficiency, consistent with exon definition. A similar analysis of intron and exon length dependence in the fly is more consistent with intron definition. Contrasted with these differences are many similarities between the two systems: Alternatively annotated introns are less efficiently spliced cotranscriptionally than constitutive introns, and introns of single-intron genes are less efficiently spliced than introns from multi-intron genes. The most striking common feature is intron position: Cotranscriptional splicing is much more efficient when introns are far from the 3' ends of their genes. Additionally, absolute gene length correlates positively with cotranscriptional splicing efficiency independently of intron location and position, in flies as well as in mice. The gene length and distance effects indicate that more "nascent time" gives rise to greater cotranscriptional splicing efficiency in both systems.},

Understanding the regulation of c-myc is important in cancer biology, as it is overexpressed in a wide variety of human cancers, including most gynecological, breast, and colon cancers. We previously demonstrated that a guanine-rich region upstream of the P1 promoter of c-myc that controls 85-90{\%} of the transcriptional activation of this gene can form an intramolecular G-quadruplex (G4) that functions as a transcriptional repressor element. In this study, we used an affinity column to purify proteins that selectively bind to the human c-myc G-quadruplex. We found that nucleolin, a multifunctional phosphoprotein, binds in vitro to the c-myc G-quadruplex structure with high affinity and selectivity when compared with other known quadruplex structures. In addition, we demonstrate that upon binding, nucleolin facilitates the formation and increases the stability of the c-myc G-quadruplex structure. Furthermore, we provide evidence that nucleolin overexpression reduces the activity of a c-myc promoter in plasmid presumably by inducing and stabilizing the formation of the c-myc G-quadruplex. Finally, we show that nucleolin binds to the c-myc promoter in HeLa cells, which indicates that this interaction occurs in vivo. In summary, nucleolin may induce c-myc G4 formation in vivo.},

EXTs can be divided into several classes: classical EXTs, short EXTs, leucine-rich repeat extensins (LRXs), proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinases (PERKs), formin-homolog EXTs (FH EXTs), chimeric EXTs, and long chimeric EXTs. To guide future research on the EXTs and understand evolutionary history of EXTs in the plant kingdom, a bioinformatics study was conducted to identify and classify EXTs from 16 fully sequenced plant genomes, including Ostreococcus lucimarinus, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Volvox carteri, Klebsormidium flaccidum, Physcomitrella patens, Selaginella moellendorffii, Pinus taeda, Picea abies, Brachypodium distachyon, Zea mays, Oryza sativa, Glycine max, Medicago truncatula, Brassica rapa, Solanum lycopersicum, and Solanum tuberosum, to supplement data previously obtained from Arabidopsis thaliana and Populus trichocarpa. A total of 758 EXTs were newly identified, including 87 classical EXTs, 97 short EXTs, 61 LRXs, 75 PERKs, 54 FH EXTs, 38 long chimeric EXTs, and 346 other chimeric EXTs. Several notable findings were made: (1) classical EXTs were likely derived after the terrestrialization of plants; (2) LRXs, PERKs, and FHs were derived earlier than classical EXTs; (3) monocots have few classical EXTs; (4) Eudicots have the greatest number of classical EXTs and Tyr-X-Tyr cross-linking motifs are predominantly in classical EXTs; (5) green algae have no classical EXTs but have a number of long chimeric EXTs that are absent in embryophytes. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis was conducted of LRXs, PERKs and FH EXTs, which shed light on the evolution of three EXT classes.},

The purine-rich strand of the NHE III1 element has been shown to be a silencer element for c-MYC transcription upon formation of a G-quadruplex structure. We have determined the predominant G-quadruplex structure of this silencer element in potassium solution by NMR. The G-quadruplex structure adopts an intramolecular parallel-stranded quadruplex conformation with three guanine tetrads and three side loops, including two single-nucleotide side loops and one double-nucleotide side loop, that connect the four guanine strands. The three side loops are very stable and well-defined. The 3‘-flanking sequence forms a stable fold-back stacking conformation capping the top end of the G-quadruplex structure.

abstract = {Guanine-rich DNA sequences that can adopt non-Watson-Crick structures in vitro are prevalent in the human genome. Whether such structures normally exist in mammalian cells has, however, been the subject of active research for decades. Here we show that the G-quadruplex-interacting drug pyridostatin promotes growth arrest in human cancer cells by inducing replication- and transcription-dependent DNA damage. A chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis of the DNA damage marker gammaH2AX provided the genome-wide distribution of pyridostatin-induced sites of damage and revealed that pyridostatin targets gene bodies containing clusters of sequences with a propensity for G-quadruplex formation. As a result, pyridostatin modulated the expression of these genes, including the proto-oncogene SRC. We observed that pyridostatin reduced SRC protein abundance and SRC-dependent cellular motility in human breast cancer cells, validating SRC as a target of this drug. Our unbiased approach to define genomic sites of action for a drug establishes a framework for discovering functional DNA-drug interactions.},

Here we purify and characterize stable, conformationally homogenous human telomeric G-quadruplexes, and demonstrate that human telomerase is able to extend parallel, intermolecular conformations in vitro. These G-quadruplexes align correctly with the RNA template of telomerase, demonstrating that at least partial G-quadruplex resolution is required. A highly purified preparation of human telomerase retains this extension ability, establishing that the core telomerase enzyme complex is sufficient for partial G-quadruplex resolution and extension. The parallel-specific G-quadruplex ligand N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMM) causes an increase in telomeric G-quadruplexes, and we show that telomerase colocalizes with a subset of telomeric G-quadruplexes in vivo. The ability of telomerase to partially unwind, extend and localize to these structures implies that parallel telomeric G-quadruplexes may play an important biological role.},

abstract = {Analyzing vertebrate genomes requires rapid mRNA/DNA and cross-species protein alignments. A new tool, BLAT, is more accurate and 500 times faster than popular existing tools for mRNA/DNA alignments and 50 times faster for protein alignments at sensitivity settings typically used when comparing vertebrate sequences. BLAT's speed stems from an index of all nonoverlapping K-mers in the genome. This index fits inside the RAM of inexpensive computers, and need only be computed once for each genome assembly. BLAT has several major stages. It uses the index to find regions in the genome likely to be homologous to the query sequence. It performs an alignment between homologous regions. It stitches together these aligned regions (often exons) into larger alignments (typically genes). Finally, BLAT revisits small internal exons possibly missed at the first stage and adjusts large gap boundaries that have canonical splice sites where feasible. This paper describes how BLAT was optimized. Effects on speed and sensitivity are explored for various K-mer sizes, mismatch schemes, and number of required index matches. BLAT is compared with other alignment programs on various test sets and then used in several genome-wide applications. http://genome.ucsc.edu hosts a web-based BLAT server for the human genome.},

abstract = {To understand how potential for G-quadruplex formation might influence regulation of gene expression, we examined the 2 kb spanning the transcription start sites (TSS) of the 18 217 human RefSeq genes, distinguishing contributions of template and nontemplate strands. Regions both upstream and downstream of the TSS are G-rich, but the downstream region displays a clear bias toward G-richness on the nontemplate strand. Upstream of the TSS, much of the G-richness and potential for G-quadruplex formation derives from the presence of well-defined canonical regulatory motifs in duplex DNA, including CpG dinucleotides which are sites of regulatory methylation, and motifs recognized by the transcription factor SP1. This challenges the notion that quadruplex formation upstream of the TSS contributes to regulation of gene expression. Downstream of the TSS, G-richness is concentrated in the first intron, and on the nontemplate strand, where polymorphic sequence elements with potential to form G-quadruplex structures and which cannot be accounted for by known regulatory motifs are found in almost 3000 (16{\%}) of the human RefSeq genes, and are conserved through frogs. These elements could in principle be recognized either as DNA or as RNA, providing structural targets for regulation at the level of transcription or RNA processing.},

@article{Roberts1992,
abstract = {Studies of a series of short oligonucleotide double and triple helices containing either all RNA, all DNA, or a mixture of the two show strand-dependent variation in their stability and structure. The variation in stability for both groups falls over a range of greater than 10 kilocalories per mole. In forming the triple helix, RNA is favored on both pyrimidine strands, whereas DNA is favored on the purine strand. In general, relatively unstable duplexes form particularly stable triplexes and vice versa. Structural data indicate thatthe strands in hybrid helices adopt a conformation that is intermediate between molecules containing all DNA and all RNA. Thus, RNA-DNA hybrids were not forced into the conformation of the RNA (A-form). The provocative stability of the triplex with an RNA third strand + DNA duplex points to novel antisense strategies and opens the possibility of an in vivo role of these structures. Overall, the data emphasize the fundamental role of sugars in determining the properties of nucleic acid complexes. Intermolecular triple helix formation has been implicated as a possible means of controlling cellular processes, either by an endogenous or exogenous mechanism. Tri-plexes have been shown to inhibit protein-DNA interaction and function in vitro (1), and there is evidence for similar inhibition in vivo (2). Functional triplexes could in principle be formed from some combination of RNA and DNA strands. However, relatively little is known about the role of strand composition, or even which complexes are stable. We report that there are dramatic differences in the stability and other properties of DNA, RNA, and hybrid duplexes and triplexes made from oligonu-cleotides. A simple view of the structure of RNA-DNA hybrid double and triple helices is that all strands are A form, with a C-3'endo sugar pucker. The rationale is that DNA can adopt either A-or B-form geometry (C-3'endo and C-2'endo sugar puckers, respectively), whereas RNA is overwhelmingly seen in the A form. Hybrids should thus adopt an A-form geometry to conform to the RNA strand. The single x-ray structure available for an RNA-DNA hybrid duplex supports this notion (3). The molecule contains both hybrid regions and all DNA duplex regions, all of which are A form. Similarly, fiber diffraction of homo and hybrid triplexes indicates that at high humidity they are all A form and have 11-or 12-fold helices with pitches ranging from 3.06 to 3.26 A (4). However, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (5) and fiber diffraction (6) of hybrid duplexes and NMR of DNA triplex-es (7) demonstrate the heteronomous nature of their structures (individual strands differ in their sugar pucker). In hybrid duplexes, the RNA strand appears C-3'endo (A-like), whereas the DNA strand does not (5). In DNA triple helices, the pyrimidine (Py) strands show a mixture of C-3'endo and C-2'endo sugar puckers, whereas the purine (Pu) strand is almost completely C-2'endo (B-like) (7). We show by comparative electrophoresis and circular dichroism (CD) measurements on homo and hybrid duplexes and triplexes that there is a gradient of structure between all-DNA and all-RNA helices. Triplex thermodynamics was measured either as the free energy (AG0) of binding the third strand to a duplex (triplex stability) or as the total AG' of forming triplex from the component single strands (total stability). These two measures turn out to be quite different. We find a general, if imperfect, anticorrelation between triplex stability and the stability of the underlying duplex. Relative instability appears to char-A' acterize duplexes with hightriplex stability, perhaps because the duplex structure is compatible with third-strand binding. Correspondingly , the energy required to distort the more stable duplex structures to form the triplex may be the source of their relative triplex instability. Total stability is markedly greater for triplexes in which the third strand is RNA. The observed variability in the complexes must lie in the chemical differences between RNA and DNA: the 2'OH and the thymine methyl groups, respectively. RNA should be favored where the preferred geometry is C-3'endo, and DNA should be favored when it is C-2'endo or when the hydrophobic effect plays a role (from burial of the thymine methyl). A methyl group on the 5 position of the pyrimidine ring has been shown to be stabilizing in the case of cytosine for the triple helix (8), probably because of the hydrophobic effect rather than alteration of the pKa of cytosine (9). We used oligonucleotide constructs consisting of a hairpin duplex with 5' Pu and 3' Py ends, and a Py third strand (10). The molecules synthesized (see Fig. 1) include four hairpin duplexes: (i) all DNA [DD]; (ii) all RNA [RRJ; (iii) DNA Pu strand + RNA Py strand [DRI; and (iv) RNA Pu strand + DNA Py strand IRD]. In addition, there are two all-Py third strands: (i) all DNA [D]; and (ii) all RNA [R] (11). All eight possible combinations of duplex with third strand were tested. Only six of the eight possible triplexes could be formed. Illustrative melting curves taken at pH 5.5 for these complexes are shown in Fig. 2. In the case for the two triplexes that do not form (D + RD, D + RR), only the transition corresponding to self-structure of the DNA Py strand (melt-ing temperature Tm = 22MC, half-height width of derivative melting curve = 11 .0C) is seen at low temperature.

abstract = {Background: Many studies have shown that guanine-rich DNA sequences form quadruplex structures (G4) in vitro but there is scarce evidence of guanine quadruplexes in vivo. The majority of potential quadruplex-forming sequences (PQS) are located in transposable elements (TEs), especially close to promoters within long terminal repeats of plant LTR retrotransposons. Results: In order to test the potential effect of G4s on retrotransposon expression, we cloned the long terminal repeats of selected maize LTR retrotransposons upstream of the lacZ reporter gene and measured its transcription and translation in yeast. We found that G4s had an inhibitory effect on translation in vivo since " mutants " (where guanines were replaced by adenines in PQS) showed higher expression levels than wild-types. In parallel, we confirmed by circular dichroism measurements that the selected sequences can indeed adopt G4 conformation in vitro. Analysis of RNA-Seq of polyA RNA in maize seedlings grown in the presence of a G4-stabilizing ligand (NMM) showed both inhibitory as well as stimulatory effects on the transcription of LTR retrotransposons. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that quadruplex DNA located within long terminal repeats of LTR retrotransposons can be formed in vivo and that it plays a regulatory role in the LTR retrotransposon life-cycle, thus also affecting genome dynamics.},

Recent studies have shown that cellular signaling pathways can regulate gene transcription and signaling outcomes by controlling Pol II pausing in a wide array of biological systems. Identification of the proteins and small molecules that affect the establishment and release of paused Pol II is shedding new light on the mechanisms and biology of Pol II pausing.

The sequencing of many genomes has revealed that they are rich in sequence motifs that have the potential to form G-quadruplexes and that their location is non-random, correlating with functionally important genomic regions. In this short review, we summarize recent evidence for the in vivo presence and function of DNA and RNA G-quadruplexes in various cellular pathways including DNA replication, gene expression and telomere maintenance. We also highlight remaining open questions that will have to be addressed in the future.},

abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

abstract = {Motivation G-quadruplexes (G4s) are one of the non-B DNA structures easily observed in vitro and assumed to form in vivo. The latest experiments with G4-specific antibodies and G4-unwinding helicase mutants confirm this conjecture. These four-stranded structures have also been shown to influence a range of molecular processes in cells. As G4s are intensively studied, it is often desirable to screen DNA sequences and pinpoint the precise locations where they might form. Results We describe and have tested a newly developed Bioconductor package for identifying potential quadruplex-forming sequences (PQS). The package is easy-to-use, flexible and customizable. It allows for sequence searches that accommodate possible divergences from the optimal G4 base composition. A novel aspect of our research was the creation and training (parametrization) of an advanced scoring model which resulted in increased precision compared to similar tools. We demonstrate that the algorithm behind the searches has a 96{\%} accuracy on 392 currently known and experimentally observed G4 structures. We also carried out searches against the recent G4-seq data to verify how well we can identify the structures detected by that technology. The correlation with pqsfinder predictions was 0.622, higher than the correlation 0.491 obtained with the second best G4Hunter.

abstract = {The remarkable selectivity of N-Me mesoporphyrin IX (NMM) for G-quadruplexes (GQs) is well-known; however, its ability to stabilize and bind GQs has not been investigated in detail. Through the use of CD, UV-visible spectroscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) melting assay we have shown that NMM stabilizes human telomeric DNA dAG3(TTAG3)3 (Tel22) and is selective for its parallel conformation to which it binds in 1:1 stoichiometry with a binding const. of ∼1.0 × 105 M-1. NMM does not interact with an antiparallel conformation of Tel22 in sodium buffer and is the second example in the literature, after TOxaPy, of a ligand with an excellent selectivity for a specific GQ structure. NMM's stabilizing ability toward predominantly parallel GQ conformation is universal; it stabilizes a variety of biol. relevant G-rich sequences including telomeres and oncogene promoters. The N-Me group is integral for selectivity and stabilization, as the unmethylated analog, mesoporphyrin IX, does not stabilize GQ DNA in FRET melting assays. Finally, NMM induces the isomerization of Tel22 into a structure with increased parallel component in K+ but not in Na+ buffer. The ability of NMM to cause structural rearrangement and efficient stabilization of Tel22 may bear biol. significance. [on SciFinder(R)]},

Here we report an in-depth analysis of 15 diverse human tissue and cell line transcriptomes on the basis of deep sequencing of complementary DNA fragments, yielding a digital inventory of gene and mRNA isoform expression. Analyses in which sequence reads are mapped to exon-exon junctions indicated that 92-94{\%} of human genes undergo alternative splicing, 86{\%} with a minor isoform frequency of 15{\%} or more. Differences in isoform-specific read densities indicated that most alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation events vary between tissues, whereas variation between individuals was approximately twofold to threefold less common. Extreme or 'switch-like' regulation of splicing between tissues was associated with increased sequence conservation in regulatory regions and with generation of full-length open reading frames. Patterns of alternative splicing and alternative cleavage and polyadenylation were strongly correlated across tissues, suggesting coordinated regulation of these processes, and sequence conservation of a subset of known regulatory motifs in both alternative introns and 3' untranslated regions suggested common involvement of specific factors in tissue-level regulation of both splicing and polyadenylation.},

However, the qualitative and quantitative mechanisms controlling cell wall enlargement are still poorly understood. Here, we report the molecular and functional characterization of LRX1, a new Arabidopsis gene that encodes a chimeric leucine-rich repeat/extensin protein. LRX1 is expressed in root hair cells and the protein is specifically localized in the wall of the hair proper, where it becomes insolubilized during development. lrx1-null mutants, isolated by a reverse-genetic approach, develop root hairs that frequently abort, swell, or branch. Complementation and overexpression experiments using modified LRX1 proteins indicate that the interaction with the cell wall is important for LRX1 function. These results suggest that LRX1 is an extracellular component of a mechanism regulating root hair morphogenesis and elongation by controlling either polarized growth or cell wall formation and assembly.},

Intronic RNAs were abundant in brain tissue, particularly for genes involved in axonal growth and synaptic transmission. Moreover, we detected significant differences in intronic RNA levels between fetal and adult brains. We show that the pattern of intronic sequence read coverage is explained by nascent transcription in combination with co-transcriptional splicing. Further analysis of co-transcriptional splicing indicates a correlation between slowly removed introns and alternative splicing.

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that repress protein synthesis by binding to target messenger RNAs. We investigated the effect of target secondary structure on the efficacy of repression by miRNAs. Using structures predicted by the Sfold program, we model the interaction between an miRNA and a target as a two-step hybridization reaction: nucleation at an accessible target site followed by hybrid elongation to disrupt local target secondary structure and form the complete miRNA-target duplex. This model accurately accounts for the sensitivity to repression by let-7 of various mutant forms of the Caenorhabditis elegans lin-41 3' untranslated region and for other experimentally tested miRNA-target interactions in C. elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. These findings indicate a potent effect of target structure on target recognition by miRNAs and establish a structure-based framework for genome-wide identification of animal miRNA targets.},

@article{DelaMata2010,
abstract = {Alternative splicing accounts for much of the complexity in higher eukaryotes. Thus, its regulation must allow for flexibility without hampering either its specificity or its fidelity. The mechanisms involved in alternative splicing regulation, especially those acting through coupling with transcription, have not been deeply studied in in vivo models. Much of our knowledge comes from in vitro approaches, where conditions can be precisely controlled at the expense of losing several levels of regulation present in intact cells. Here we studied the relative order of removal of the introns flanking a model alternative cassette exon. We show that there is a preferential removal of the intron downstream from the cassette exon before the upstream intron has been removed. Most importantly, both cis-acting mutations and trans-acting factors that regulate the model alternative splicing event differentially affect the relative order of removal. However, reduction of transcriptional elongation causing higher inclusion of the cassette exon does not change the order of intron removal, suggesting that the assumption, according to the "first come, first served" model, that slow elongation promotes preferential excision of the upstream intron has to be revised. We propose instead that slow elongation favors commitment to exon inclusion during spliceosome assembly. Our results reveal that measuring the order of intron removal may be a straightforward read-out to discriminate among different mechanisms of alternative splice site selection.},

@article{Gibbons2000,
abstract = {A goal of molecular genetics is to understand the relationship between basic nuclear processes, epigenetic changes and the numerous proteins that orchestrate these effects. One such protein, {\{}ATRX,{\}} contains a highly conserved plant homeodomain {\{}(PHD)-like{\}} domain, present in many chromatin-associated proteins, and a carboxy-terminal domain which identifies it as a member of the {\{}SNF2{\}} family of {\{}helicase/ATPases.{\}} Mutations in {\{}ATRX{\}} give rise to characteristic developmental abnormalities including severe mental retardation, facial dysmorphism, urogenital abnormalities and alpha-thalassaemia. This circumstantial evidence suggests that {\{}ATRX{\}} may act as a transcriptional regulator through an effect on chromatin. We have recently shown that {\{}ATRX{\}} is localized to pericentromeric heterochromatin during interphase and mitosis, suggesting that {\{}ATRX{\}} might exert other chromatin-mediated effects in the nucleus. Moreover, at metaphase, some {\{}ATRX{\}} is localized at or close to the ribosomal {\{}DNA{\}} {\{}(rDNA){\}} arrays on the short arms of human acrocentric chromosomes. Here we show that mutations in {\{}ATRX{\}} give rise to changes in the pattern of methylation of several highly repeated sequences including the {\{}rDNA{\}} arrays, a Y-specific satellite and subtelomeric repeats. Our findings provide a potential link between the processes of chromatin remodelling, {\{}DNA{\}} methylation and gene expression in mammalian development.},

@article{William2003,
abstract = {The switch from vegetative to reproductive development in plants necessitates a switch in the developmental program of the descendents of the stem cells in the shoot apical meristem. Genetic and molecular investigations have demonstrated that the plant-specific transcription factor and meristem identity regulator LEAFY (LFY) controls this developmental transition by inducing expression of a second transcription factor, APETALA1, and by regulating the expression of additional, as yet unknown, genes. Here we show that the additional LFY targets include the APETALA1-related factor, CAULIFLOWER, as well as three transcription factors and two putative signal transduction pathway components. These genes are up-regulated by LFY even when protein synthesis is inhibited and, hence, appear to be direct targets of LFY. Supporting this conclusion, cis-regulatory regions upstream of these genes are bound by LFY in vivo. The newly identified LFY targets likely initiate the transcriptional changes that are required for the switch from vegetative to reproductive development in Arabidopsis.},

Some of its subunits also belong to complexes involved in other cellular processes, such as chromosome segregation and cell cycle regulation, emphasizing the multitasking capabilities of this factor. This review aims to depict the structure of TFIIH and to dissect the roles of its subunits in different cellular mechanisms. Our understanding of the biochemistry of TFIIH has greatly benefited from studies focused on dis-eases related to TFIIH mutations. We address the etiology of these disorders and underline the fact that TFIIH can be considered a promising target for therapeutic strategies.},
