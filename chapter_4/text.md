# Global analysis of G-Quadruplexes in plant genomes

## Introduction

## Materials and Methods

## Results

### The genome of *Arabidopsis thaliana* is G4-poor.

### G4s are non-uniformly distributed in the *Arabidopsis* genome

### G4s are enriched in 5' UTRs and Coding Regions.

### Reverse translation permutation testing reveals codon usage bias towards G4 formation in template strand 5' UTRs.
